# Sermon

Good morning, brothers and sisters in Christ. Today, we will be focusing on a passage found in 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, which discusses sexual immorality and church discipline.

To provide some context, this letter was written by the apostle Paul to the church in Corinth. The city was known for its rampant sexual immorality and idol worship, and this church was struggling with similar issues. In this particular passage, Paul addresses a specific situation where a man in the church was engaging in sexual immorality with his stepmother, which was not only a violation of God's law but also socially unacceptable.

In this passage, the main message is clear: sexual immorality is not to be tolerated within the church. Paul instructs the church to remove the man from their midst and not associate with him until he repents and turns away from his sin. He also emphasizes the need for the church to hold each other accountable for their actions and maintain purity within the body of Christ.

The lesson we can take away from this passage is that sin has consequences, both for the individual and for the community as a whole. While we are called to love and forgive one another, we are also responsible for upholding God's standards of righteousness. It is not loving to ignore or condone sin, and sometimes discipline is necessary for the sake of restoration and protection.

So how can we apply this message to our lives today? We must be diligent in guarding our hearts and minds against sexual immorality and other forms of sin. We must also be willing to hold each other accountable and seek restoration when someone falls into sin. However, we must do so with the spirit of gentleness and humility, always keeping in mind our own susceptibility to sin.

In conclusion, let us remember that we are called to be holy, set apart for God's purposes. Let us strive for purity in our thoughts, words, and actions, and be willing to confront sin when necessary, all with the goal of bringing glory to God and building up the body of Christ. Amen.
