In 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, Paul addresses the issue of sexual immorality within the church in Corinth. He begins by stating that he has heard reports of a man who is engaged in sexual relations with his stepmother, which is considered sexually immoral even among non-believers. 

Paul goes on to say that the church should not tolerate such behavior and that they should remove the man from their fellowship. He even suggests that the man should be handed over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. 

This may sound harsh, but Paul explains that allowing such sin to continue within the church would compromise its purity and lead to the spread of sin among the members. He reminds the Corinthians that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, meaning that sin left unaddressed can spread and infect the entire community. 

Paul also makes it clear that the church should only discipline those within its own walls, not those outside the church. He clarifies that he is not advocating for Christians to cut themselves off from the world, but rather to hold each other accountable for their actions within the church. 

So how can we apply this passage to our own lives? First and foremost, it reminds us of the importance of purity within the church. We should not turn a blind eye to sin among our fellow believers, but rather address it with love and humility, seeking restoration and reconciliation. 

We should also be mindful of our own behavior, striving to live lives that are pleasing to God and avoiding any actions that could compromise our witness or lead others into sin. And finally, we should remember to extend grace and forgiveness to those who repent and seek to turn away from their sin, just as Paul instructs the Corinthians to do in 2 Corinthians 2:7-8.
