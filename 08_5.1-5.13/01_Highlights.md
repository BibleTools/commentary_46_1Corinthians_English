In 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, Paul addresses the issue of sexual immorality within the church in Corinth. He begins by highlighting a specific case where a man is involved in a sexual relationship with his stepmother, which is considered a sin even among the Gentile cultures. Paul is clear that such behavior cannot be tolerated within the Christian community and needs to be immediately addressed. He argues that it is not only harmful to the individual but also to the entire church community.

Paul emphasizes the importance of church discipline in such cases, which involves confronting the offender and removing them from the community until they repent and turn away from their sinful behavior. He argues that Christians should not associate with those who profess to be believers but engage in such gross misconduct, as it sends the wrong message to both the church and the world. 

Furthermore, he reminds the Corinthians that they are called to judge those within the church, as God will ultimately judge those outside the church. He encourages them to purify their community by removing the wicked person from among them, and thus not allow evil to corrupt the rest of the church.

The passage teaches us that sexual immorality is not to be tolerated within the Christian community and should be dealt with swiftly and justly. It also reminds us of the importance of church discipline and the responsibility we have to maintain the purity of the church community.
