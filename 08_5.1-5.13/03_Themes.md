# Themes

In 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, the Apostle Paul addresses the issue of sexual immorality within the Corinthian church. 

One key theme expressed in this passage is the importance of maintaining purity within the church. Paul is concerned that the presence of sexual sin in the church will lead to the corruption of the entire community. He instructs the church to remove the offender from their midst, so that they can maintain their holiness and purity.

Another theme in this passage is the importance of church discipline. Paul stresses that it is the responsibility of the church to hold its members accountable for their behavior, and that this includes the use of discipline when necessary. The goal of discipline is not to condemn or punish, but to bring the offender to repentance and restoration.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand the severity of the situation. The Greek word used for "sexual immorality" is "porneia," which refers to any form of sexual activity outside of marriage. This includes adultery, homosexuality, and other forms of sexual sin. The word "immorality" is translated from the Greek "aselgeia," which means "licentiousness" or "unbridled lust." This emphasizes the seriousness of the sin and the need for immediate action.

The theological implications of this passage are significant. It demonstrates that sin within the church must be taken seriously, and that there are consequences for unrepentant behavior. It also highlights the importance of maintaining purity and holiness within the community of believers.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage by providing examples of God's judgment against sexual sin. For example, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19 illustrates God's wrath against the sin of homosexuality. Additionally, the story of Achan in Joshua 7 demonstrates the importance of dealing with sin within the community of believers.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us of the importance of living a holy and pure life. It also emphasizes the need for accountability and discipline within the church, as well as the power of repentance and restoration.
