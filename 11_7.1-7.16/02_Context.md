# Context

The historical context of 1 Corinthians 7 and its significance regarding the struggles of early Christians is essential for a better understanding of the passage. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul is addressing the issue of marriage and divorce, which was a major issue in the early Christian community. 

During this time, the Roman Empire was the major political power, and its laws governed marriage and divorce. Marriage was viewed as a political and social arrangement, and divorce was allowed for various reasons, including infidelity and incompatibility. However, within the Jewish community, marriage was a religious covenant between a man and a woman, and divorce was only permitted in cases of adultery.

Early Christian converts came from different cultures and religious backgrounds, and therefore, they had different attitudes and practices concerning marriage and divorce. Some converts saw marriage as a sacred covenant, while others saw it as a social contract. 

In this context, Paul speaks to the Corinthians about the importance of sexual morality within marriage. He acknowledges that sexual desire is natural, but he emphasizes that the union of a man and a woman in marriage is the only permissible outlet for this desire. Paul urges married couples to fulfill their sexual obligations to each other and to avoid tempting situations that could lead to infidelity.

Regarding divorce, Paul affirms the Jewish view that divorce should only be permitted in cases of infidelity. He also emphasizes that believers should not divorce their unbelieving spouses, but rather, should seek to live in peace with them. Paul advises the believers to remain in their current state, whether married or unmarried, and to use their time to serve the Lord.

In conclusion, the historical context of 1 Corinthians 7 helps us to understand the struggles that early Christians faced regarding marriage and divorce. Paul's teachings reflect the tension between the Roman and Jewish views of marriage and divorce, and his advice emphasizes the importance of sexual morality and preserving the integrity of marriage, while also acknowledging the challenges that believers may face in their relationships.
