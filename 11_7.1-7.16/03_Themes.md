# Themes

1 Corinthians 7:1-16 addresses the topic of marriage and divorce. The passage is written in response to questions posed by the Corinthian church regarding marriage and sexual ethics. 

The first theme expressed in the passage is the importance of sexual purity within the context of marriage. The apostle Paul affirms that it is good for a man to have a wife and a woman to have a husband in order to avoid sexual immorality. He emphasizes that both the husband and wife have a responsibility to fulfill each other's sexual needs within the marriage relationship. 

Biblical Greek studies help us understand this theme by highlighting the word "aphiemi" which is translated as "to withhold oneself from." This word implies that a husband or wife should not refuse sexual intimacy to their spouse unless it is agreed upon mutually. The use of the word "aphiemi" emphasizes the mutual obligation of the husband and wife to each other's sexual needs. 

The second theme expressed in the passage is the sanctity of marriage. Paul emphasizes that marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman that should not be broken. He states that a husband should not divorce his wife and a wife should not divorce her husband. However, Paul does make an exception in cases of marital unfaithfulness where divorce may be permissible. 

Biblical Greek studies help us understand this theme by highlighting the word "chorizo" which is translated as "to separate." This word is used when referring to divorce and emphasizes the permanent separation of a husband and wife. 

The third theme expressed in the passage is the importance of being content in the circumstances in which one finds themselves. Paul encourages those who are unmarried to remain single if they are able to do so and devote themselves to serving the Lord. He also encourages those who are married to remain in their marriage and work to reconcile any issues that may arise. 

The theological implications of this passage are significant. It emphasizes the sanctity of marriage and the importance of fulfilling one's obligations within the marriage relationship. It also highlights the importance of being content in one's circumstances and trusting in God's plan for our lives. 

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this New Testament passage by providing examples of marriage relationships, both positive and negative. For example, the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2:18-24 provides an example of the sanctity of marriage and the importance of a husband and wife becoming one flesh. The story of David and Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11-12 provides an example of the consequences of marital unfaithfulness. 

In conclusion, the message conveyed in this passage emphasizes the importance of sexual purity, the sanctity of marriage, and being content in one's circumstances. It impacts our connection with God by highlighting the importance of fulfilling our obligations within the marriage relationship and trusting in God's plan for our lives.
