1 Corinthians 7:1-16 speaks about marriage and divorce. The passage addresses questions from the Corinthian church about marriage, sexual purity, and divorce. The Apostle Paul's response provides some practical guidance on these issues.

In verse 1, Paul addresses the issue of sexual immorality and advises that it is good for a man to have a wife and a woman to have a husband to avoid falling into temptation. This implies that sexual intimacy is an important aspect of marriage and should only take place within the confines of marriage.

In verses 2-5, Paul advises married couples to fulfill their marital duties to each other and not to deprive each other of sexual intimacy. He also suggests that couples should only take a break from physical intimacy for a limited time and with mutual agreement, so that Satan does not tempt them due to lack of self-control.

In verse 10, Paul talks about the responsibilities of a married couple towards each other, and how divorce should not be taken lightly. He advises that couples should not separate unless it is In verses 12-16, Paul addresses the issue of a believer being married to an unbeliever. He advises that if a believer is already married to an unbeliever, they should not seek divorce but should try to remain in the marriage if possible. The believer's conduct and love for the unbelieving spouse may help bring them to Christ. However, if the unbeliever chooses to leave, the believer is not bound to remain in the marriage.

Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of sexual purity and faithfulness within marriage, the sanctity of the marriage covenant, and the seriousness of divorce. It also addresses some practical issues that may arise in marriage, such as being married to an unbeliever, and provides guidance on how to approach these situations. Christians should take these teachings to heart and apply them to their own lives and relationships with God and others.
