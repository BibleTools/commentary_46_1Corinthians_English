In 1 Corinthians 7:1-16, Paul addresses the issue of marriage and divorce. He begins by stating that it is good for a man not to marry, but acknowledges that not everyone has the gift of celibacy (verse 1). He then goes on to provide guidance for those who are married, advising husbands and wives to fulfill their sexual obligations to one another (verses 2-5).

Paul also discusses the issue of divorce, stating that it is not something that should be taken lightly. He says that while it is permissible for a believer to divorce an unbelieving spouse, they should do everything possible to save the marriage (verses 10-16). If the unbelieving spouse is willing to stay, the believer should not divorce them.

The key words and phrases used in this passage include "celibacy," "sexual obligations," "divorce," "permissible," "unbelieving spouse," and "save the marriage."

Additionally, the concept of marriage representing the relationship between Christ and the Church is also present in both passages.
