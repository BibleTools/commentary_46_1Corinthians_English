We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. What is the context of this passage? What is Paul addressing in this chapter?
2. What does Paul mean when he says, "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman" (verse 1)? Is he advocating for celibacy?
3. Why does Paul encourage married couples to have regular sexual relations (verse 5)? What is the purpose of sex in marriage?
4. What is Paul's advice for those who are married to unbelievers (verses 12-14)? How should they conduct themselves in the marriage?
5. According to this passage, how should Christians view divorce (verses 10-11, 15)? Why does Paul discourage divorce?
6. In verse 16, Paul says, "For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?" What does he mean by this? How should it impact our view of marriage and relationships with unbelievers?
