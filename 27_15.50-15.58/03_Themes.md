Understanding the original Greek language is significant to grasp the full meaning of this passage. The word for "flesh and blood" in verse 50 is sarx kai haima, which indicates physical, mortal bodies.

This transformation is made possible by Christ's resurrection, which is the ultimate victory over death and sin. This victory is emphasized in verse 54, where death is swallowed up in victory.

This is emphasized in verses 51-53, where it is described that believers will not all die, but will be transformed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. This transformation will allow believers to inherit the kingdom of God and to experience eternal life.
