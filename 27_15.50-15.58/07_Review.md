# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. What does Paul mean by "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God"? (verse 50)

2. How does the resurrection of Christ and the transformation of our bodies relate to each other? (verse 51-52)

3. What does it mean that "this mortal body must put on immortality"? (verse 53)

4. How does the victory over death and sin through Christ's resurrection impact our lives today? (verse 54-57)

5. In what ways can we "be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord" as mentioned in verse 58?

6. How can we practically apply the truths of this passage to our daily lives?

7. How can we share the message of victory over death and sin with others, especially those who do not believe in Christ?
