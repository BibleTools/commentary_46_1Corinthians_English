# Devotion

1 Corinthians 8:1-13 addresses an issue that was causing division in the church of Corinth. Some believers were eating food offered to idols while others were abstaining from it. The passage teaches us that knowledge puffs up but love builds up. It reminds us that our actions have a direct impact on our brothers and sisters in Christ.

In the context of the passage, some believers were eating food offered to idols because they knew that idols were not real and that food was just food. However, some believers who had come out of pagan backgrounds were still struggling with the idea of eating food that had been offered to idols. They feared that they would be participating in idol worship by doing so.

Paul reminds us that knowledge alone is not enough. Although the believers who were eating food offered to idols had knowledge that idols were not real and that food was just food, they were causing their brothers and sisters to stumble. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. We must be considerate of others and not just act in accordance with what we know.

As believers, we must be careful of our actions and how they impact others. We should not be quick to judge those who are weaker in faith or to cause them to stumble. Instead, we should act in love, seeking to build up others and not tear them down. We should be willing to give up certain freedoms if it means building up others in the faith.

In our own lives, we may not face the exact same issue of food offered to idols, but we can apply the principles of this passage to other areas of our lives. We must be careful not to let our knowledge puff us up and cause us to act in ways that are harmful to others. Instead, we should seek to act in love, always considering how our actions will impact those around us.

Let us pray:

Dear God,

We come before you today with hearts full of gratitude for the gift of salvation through your son Jesus Christ. We thank you for your Word, which guides our steps and helps us to live according to your will.

As we meditate on the passage from 1 Corinthians 8:1-13, we are reminded of the problem of food offered to idols. We acknowledge that this is a sensitive issue that can cause division and confusion among your people.

We pray for wisdom and discernment as we navigate this issue. Help us to put the needs of others before our own desires and preferences. May we always be mindful of the impact of our actions on our fellow believers.

We ask for your protection against the lure of idolatry and false gods. May we always keep our hearts and minds focused on you, the one true God.

Thank you for your unfailing love and grace. We pray that your will be done in our lives and in the lives of those around us. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
