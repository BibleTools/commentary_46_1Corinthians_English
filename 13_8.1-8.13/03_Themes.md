1 Corinthians 8:1-13 is a New Testament passage that addresses the problem of food offered to idols. The passage deals with the issue of whether Christians should eat food that has been offered to idols, and how to handle the situation when a weaker Christian's conscience is bothered by this.

Themes:
1. Knowledge and Love – The passage highlights the importance of knowledge and love in Christian relationships. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. This means that we should use our knowledge wisely and with love towards others, especially the weaker ones in faith.
2. Freedom in Christ – Paul emphasizes that Christians have freedom in Christ, but this freedom should not be used to harm others. We should be mindful of how our actions may affect others, and not cause them to stumble in their faith.
3. Conscience – The passage underscores the importance of conscience in Christian living. We should not violate our conscience, as it is a gift from God that guides us in discerning right from wrong. We should also respect the conscience of others, especially those who are weaker in faith.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand the nuances of the words used in the passage. For example, the word used for 'knowledge' in verse 1 is 'gnosis', which means knowledge acquired through experience or perception. This type of knowledge can be misleading if not balanced with love. The word used for 'love' in verse 1 is 'agape', which means selfless love. This type of love seeks the good of others rather than one's own interests.

Theological implications:
1. Love is the guiding principle of Christian living. We are called to love God and love others, even those who are different from us.
2. Our freedom in Christ should be exercised with wisdom and love, and not used to indulge in sinful behavior or harm others.
3. Our conscience is a gift from God that helps us discern right from wrong. We should listen to it and not violate it.

The Old Testament provides a background for the issue of food offered to idols. In the Old Testament, there were many laws regarding food and sacrifice. For example, in Leviticus 17:7, it was forbidden to eat meat sacrificed to idols. In Deuteronomy 32:17, idolatry is described as sacrificing to demons. Paul's message in 1 Corinthians 8 is that idols are nothing, and therefore food offered to them is not inherently sinful. However, the weaker Christians may not have this knowledge, and so we should be mindful of their conscience.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by emphasizing the importance of love and conscience in Christian living. We are called to love God and love others, and to exercise our freedom in Christ with wisdom and love. We should also respect the conscience of others, especially those who are weaker in faith.
