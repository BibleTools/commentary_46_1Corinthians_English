# Themes

1 Corinthians 14:1-25 discusses the importance and proper use of tongues and prophecy in the church. The passage begins with Paul emphasizing the importance of love and how it should be the motivation for all spiritual gifts, including tongues and prophecy.

The key themes expressed in this passage are the importance of edification, understanding, and order in the use of spiritual gifts. Paul emphasizes that the primary purpose of spiritual gifts, specifically tongues and prophecy, is to edify and build up the church. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding, explaining that if tongues are spoken in the church, there must be someone to interpret so that everyone can understand.

Biblical Greek studies can help us understand each theme. For example, the word for "edify" in Greek is oikodomeo, which means to build up, strengthen, or encourage. The word for "understand" in Greek is nous, which means to have knowledge and comprehension.

Illustrations that aid our understanding can be found in Paul's comparison of speaking in tongues to speaking into the air or speaking in a foreign language that is not understood by anyone. He also compares prophecy to speaking directly to people's hearts and minds, in their own language.

The theological implications of this passage are that spiritual gifts should always be used for the edification of the church, and that order and understanding are important in the use of these gifts. It also highlights the importance of love as the motivation for spiritual gifts, as well as the supremacy of prophecy over tongues in terms of edification value.

The Old Testament contributes to our comprehension of this New Testament passage in the way that Paul references the prophet Isaiah, who spoke of tongues as a sign of judgment for rebellious Israelites. Paul's use of this reference emphasizes the importance of understanding and interpretation, as well as the idea that tongues are not the ultimate goal of spiritual gifts.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us that our spiritual gifts and abilities should always be used for the benefit and edification of the church, and that love should be our motivation for doing so. It also emphasizes the importance of seeking understanding and interpretation, and encourages us to strive for order and coherence in our worship services.
