In the opening verses of 1 Corinthians 1:1-3, Paul greets the church in Corinth and gives thanks to God for them. The passage begins by identifying Paul as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. This is significant because it establishes Paul's authority and emphasizes that he is writing with the backing of God. 

Paul then addresses the church in Corinth, calling them "sanctified in Christ Jesus" and "called to be saints." This language emphasizes the believers' status as set apart and holy, a theme that Paul will continue to develop throughout the letter. 

In verse 3, Paul gives thanks to God for the Corinthians, specifically for the grace that God has given them through Jesus Christ. This thanksgiving sets a positive tone for the letter and underscores the importance of gratitude in the Christian life. 

The Greek words used in this passage shed further light on its meaning. The word translated as "called" (klÄ“tos) suggests a divine summons or invitation, highlighting the idea that the believers in Corinth have been chosen by God. The word translated as "grace" (charis) refers to the unmerited favor that God has shown to humanity through Jesus Christ. 

Overall, this passage sets the stage for Paul's message to the Corinthians by establishing his authority as an apostle, emphasizing the believers' status as holy and chosen by God, and emphasizing the importance of gratitude for God's grace.
