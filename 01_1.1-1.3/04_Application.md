# Application

1 Corinthians 1:1-3 reads:

"Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christâ€”their Lord and ours: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

This passage is a greeting and thanksgiving from Paul to the church in Corinth. Paul starts by introducing himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus, chosen by God for this role. He also mentions Sosthenes, who was likely the co-author or secretary of this letter.

The greeting is addressed to the church of God in Corinth, which refers to all the believers in that city. Paul acknowledges that they are sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people. This means that their sins have been forgiven, and they have been set apart for God's purposes. Paul also includes all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, regardless of where they are located. This emphasizes the universal nature of the Gospel and the unity of believers.

After the greeting, Paul expresses his thanksgiving to God for the Corinthians. He acknowledges the grace and peace that comes from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. He is grateful for the work that God has already accomplished in their lives and looks forward to seeing more growth and transformation.

In terms of personal application, we can learn from this passage about the importance of gratitude and recognizing the work of God in our lives. We should take time to thank God for the people in our lives who are fellow believers and partners in the Gospel. We should also remember that we are all part of a larger community of believers who are called to live for Christ. Finally, we should be encouraged by the fact that God's grace and peace are available to us, no matter where we are or what we are going through.
