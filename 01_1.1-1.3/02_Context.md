# Context

The opening of the first letter to the Corinthians, which includes the greeting and thanksgiving in 1 Corinthians 1:1-3, gives us insights into the historical context of the early Christians and the struggles they faced. 

Firstly, the letter is addressed to the church in Corinth, a wealthy and cosmopolitan city in Greece. At the time of its writing, Corinth was a hub of trade and commerce, as well as a center for intellectual and cultural exchange. The city was home to a diverse population of Greeks, Romans, and Jews, who brought with them their own traditions and beliefs. 

Secondly, the letter is written by Paul, an apostle who had founded the church in Corinth during his travels. Paul was a Jew who had converted to Christianity and was known for his teachings of Christ to the Gentiles. His mission was to spread the gospel to as many people as possible, regardless of their background or social status. 

In the greeting, Paul acknowledges himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus "by the will of God." This emphasizes the divine calling that he felt to spread the gospel and the authority that he believed came with it. This would have been reassuring to the Corinthians, who may have been uncertain about Paul's credentials and standing in the larger Christian community.

Paul also addresses the Corinthians as "the church of God that is in Corinth," emphasizing their identity as a unified community of believers. This would have been important in a city as diverse as Corinth, where social and cultural divisions may have threatened to divide the church. 

In the thanksgiving, Paul expresses gratitude for the Corinthians, specifically for the grace given to them by God through Christ Jesus. Here, we see the importance of the concept of grace in early Christianity - the idea that salvation comes through faith in Christ and not through adherence to strict Jewish law. This would have been a radical departure from the religious norms of the time, and would have had implications for how the Corinthians saw themselves and their relationship to God. 

Overall, the greeting and thanksgiving in 1 Corinthians 1:1-3 give us insights into the historical context of early Christianity, including the diversity of the early Christian community and the challenges faced by the early church in establishing a new religious identity. It also highlights the importance of Paul's role as an apostle and the centrality of the concept of grace in early Christian theology.
