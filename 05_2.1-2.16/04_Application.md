# Application

1 Corinthians 2:1-16 is a passage that offers significant insights into the nature of apostolic leadership and its application to our daily lives. 

In the passage, the Apostle Paul describes his own ministry and how he approaches it. He notes that he did not come to the Corinthians with eloquent speech or worldly wisdom, but rather with a demonstration of the Spirit's power. This highlights the fact that apostolic leadership is not about impressive speeches or displays of human intelligence, but rather about the power and work of the Holy Spirit in our lives and ministries.

Paul goes on to explain that the natural person cannot understand the things of God, because they are spiritually discerned. This indicates that the role of the apostolic leader is not to impart human knowledge or understanding, but rather to allow the Holy Spirit to reveal spiritual truths to those who are open to hearing them.

Furthermore, Paul underscores that true wisdom comes from God, not from human understanding. This highlights the importance of seeking God's wisdom and guidance in all aspects of our lives, including our leadership roles.

Finally, Paul emphasizes that we have the mind of Christ as believers. This means that we are able to discern spiritual truths and make wise decisions when we allow the Holy Spirit to guide us. As apostolic leaders, we must rely on the Holy Spirit to reveal the will of God to us and to guide us in our decision-making processes.

Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of relying on the Holy Spirit in our leadership roles, seeking God's wisdom and guidance, and recognizing that true spiritual understanding comes from God alone. As we apply these principles to our lives and ministries, we can become more effective apostolic leaders who are able to discern God's will and lead others in the way of truth and righteousness.
