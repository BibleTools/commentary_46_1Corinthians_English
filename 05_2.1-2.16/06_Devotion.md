# Devotion

Dear friends,

The passage of 1 Corinthians 2:1-16 speaks of Paul's ministry and the true nature of apostolic leadership. In this passage, Paul emphasizes that his preaching does not rely on human wisdom or eloquence, but on the power of the Holy Spirit. He reminds us that true wisdom and understanding come from God alone.

As we consider Paul's words, we are reminded of the importance of humility in leadership. It can be tempting to rely on our own intelligence or skills, but this passage reminds us that we must rely on God's wisdom and guidance in all that we do. Even the most skilled or eloquent speaker can be ineffective without the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit.

Furthermore, Paul's ministry reminds us that the gospel message is not about impressing others with our knowledge or abilities, but about sharing the good news of Jesus Christ. Our focus should always be on leading others to Christ through our words and actions.

As we reflect on Paul's words and apply them to our own lives, we must ask ourselves: Are we relying on our own wisdom and abilities, or are we seeking God's guidance and wisdom? Are we focused on impressing others with our knowledge and skills, or are we focused on leading others to Christ?

Let us pray:

Dear God,

As we come before you, we ask for your guidance and wisdom to understand the true nature of apostolic leadership. We thank you for the teachings of Paul, who dedicated his life to spreading your word and ministering to your people.

Lord, we pray that we may learn from Paul's example of humility and devotion to you. Help us to recognize that true leadership is not about status or power, but about serving others and spreading your love and grace.

We also pray for the gift of discernment, that we may understand the wisdom that comes from you and not from human knowledge or understanding. May we always rely on your guidance and seek your will in all that we do.

We ask that you continue to bless and guide us as we strive to follow in the footsteps of Paul and other apostles, and may we always remember that our ultimate goal is to glorify you and share your message of hope and salvation with the world.

In your holy name we pray,
Amen.
