# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 1, Paul says he came to the Corinthians "in weakness and fear, and with much trembling." Why do you think he felt this way, and how might this have affected his ministry among them?

2. In verses 2-5, Paul emphasizes that he preached Christ crucified "in weakness and fear, and with much trembling." How might the message of the cross have been perceived differently if Paul had presented it with confidence and eloquence?

3. In verse 6, Paul says that he speaks "wisdom among the mature." Who are the "mature" he is referring to, and how might their understanding of wisdom differ from the wisdom of the world?

4. In verses 7-8, Paul says that the wisdom of God is hidden and revealed only to those who are "spiritual." What does this mean, and how might it relate to the role of the Holy Spirit in understanding and interpreting Scripture?

5. In verses 9-10, Paul quotes from Isaiah and says that "no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has conceived" what God has prepared for those who love him. What do you think he means by this, and how might it relate to our understanding of God's ultimate plan for humanity?

6. In verses 11-12, Paul contrasts the wisdom of God with the wisdom of the world. How might the world's wisdom differ from the wisdom of God, and what are some examples of this contrast in our own lives?

7. In verses 13-14, Paul says that the Holy Spirit enables us to understand the things that come from God. How might we cultivate our own spiritual discernment, and what are some practices or disciplines that can help us do so?

8. In verses 15-16, Paul contrasts the "natural" person with the "spiritual" person. How might our own understanding of spiritual things be influenced by our natural inclinations or biases, and what are some ways we can overcome these barriers to deeper spiritual understanding?
