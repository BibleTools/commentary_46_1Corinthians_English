# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. What is the issue that Paul addresses in verses 1-6? Why do you think it is important?
2. How does Paul view lawsuits between believers? Why does he argue that they are a sign of defeat?
3. In verse 4, Paul mentions the appointment of judges from within the church. What does he mean by this, and what are the implications for the church community?
4. According to verses 7-8, what is the root cause of disputes between believers? How can we address this in our own lives?
5. In verses 9-11, Paul lists a number of sins that can keep people from inheriting the kingdom of God. How do these relate to the issue of lawsuits between believers, and what broader implications do they have for our Christian walk?
6. In what ways can we apply Paul's teaching on lawsuits to our own lives and communities today? How can we work to resolve conflicts in a way that honors God and builds up the church?
