1 Corinthians 6:1-11 discusses the issue of lawsuits between believers. In this passage, Paul is addressing a problem that had arisen among the Corinthian church members where they were taking their disputes to the secular courts instead of settling them within the church.

Paul begins by asking whether there is anyone among them who is wise enough to judge the matters between believers. He then goes on to say that the saints will judge the world and even judge angels, so they should be able to handle trivial matters.

Paul then questions the wisdom of taking disputes among believers to the secular courts. He says that if they are going to judge the world, then they should be able to judge trivial matters within the church. Paul also points out that the world will judge them for taking their disputes to the secular courts, which is a bad testimony for the church.

Paul then goes on to say that it would be better to suffer wrong or be cheated than take a fellow believer to court. He says that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God, and that includes those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, greedy, drunkards, and slanderers. Paul reminds the Corinthian church members that they were once part of this group, but they have been washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God.

In summary, Paul is exhorting the Corinthian church members to settle their disputes within the church and not take them to the secular courts. He reminds them that they will judge the world and that they should be able to handle trivial matters within the church. He also reminds them that taking disputes to the secular courts is a bad testimony for the church and that it would be better to suffer wrong or be cheated than take a fellow believer to court. Finally, he reminds them that they were once part of the unrighteous, but they have been washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God. 

To apply this passage to our daily lives, we can ask ourselves if we have been involved in a dispute with another believer and whether we have sought the help of the church to settle the dispute. We can also ask ourselves if we have been a good testimony for the church and if we have been willing to suffer wrong or be cheated for the sake of preserving unity within the body of Christ. Finally, we can reflect on the fact that we were once part of the unrighteous, but we have been washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God, and this should motivate us to live upright lives and seek the unity of the church.
