# Devotion

As we read through 1 Corinthians 1:18-31, we are presented with a contrast between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world. The passage reminds us that the wisdom of God is often viewed as foolishness by the world, and yet it is the only true and lasting source of wisdom.

Reflecting on this passage, we are reminded of how often we are tempted to trust in the wisdom of the world instead of relying on the wisdom of God. We are surrounded by messages that tell us to prioritize wealth, success, and personal gratification above all else. These messages can be seductive, and it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that success and happiness can only be found through worldly means.

However, as Paul reminds us, the wisdom of God is the only true source of wisdom that can provide us with lasting joy and fulfillment. When we trust in God's wisdom, we are able to see the world in a different light, and we are able to understand the true value of the things that we pursue. We are able to recognize that true success comes from serving others and serving God, and that the things that the world values most are often fleeting and temporary.

As we meditate on this passage, we are challenged to examine our own lives and consider whether we are relying too heavily on the wisdom of the world. We are reminded that true wisdom comes from God, and that we need to prioritize our relationship with God above all else. We are encouraged to seek out ways to deepen our understanding of God's wisdom, whether that means studying scripture, praying, or seeking guidance from wise believers.

In conclusion, let us remember that the wisdom of God is the only true source of wisdom, and that we need to be intentional about seeking it out and applying it in our lives. May we be inspired by Paul's words and strive to live our lives in a way that reflects the wisdom of God, rather than the wisdom of the world. 

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

As I come before you in prayer, I thank you for your infinite wisdom and the knowledge you have bestowed upon us. Your word tells us that the wisdom of this world is foolishness in your sight, and that we are to seek your wisdom above all else.

Lord, I pray that you would help us to understand and embrace your wisdom, even when it seems contrary to the wisdom of this world. Help us to recognize that your ways are higher than our ways, and that you alone are the source of true wisdom.

Father, I pray that you would open our hearts and minds to receive your wisdom, and that we would be willing to let go of our own understanding and lean on you completely. Help us to trust in your guidance and direction, even when it doesn't make sense to us.

Lord, I pray that you would give us the courage to stand firm in our faith, even in the face of opposition or ridicule from those who do not understand your ways. Help us to be a light in this world, shining your truth and wisdom to those around us.

Thank you, Lord, for your great love and faithfulness. May we always seek your wisdom above all else, and may we be a reflection of your love and grace to those around us.

In Jesus' name, Amen.
