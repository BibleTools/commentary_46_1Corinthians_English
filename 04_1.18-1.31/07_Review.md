# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. Verse 18 says that "the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." What does this mean to you personally?
2. Why do you think the message of the cross is considered foolishness by some?
3. In verse 22, Paul writes that "Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified." What do you think is the significance of this statement?
4. How does the wisdom of God differ from the wisdom of the world (verse 20)?
5. In verse 27, Paul writes that "God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise." Why do you think God chooses to use the seemingly foolish things of the world?
6. In verse 31, Paul writes that "it is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from Godâ€”that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption." What does it mean for Christ to be our wisdom from God?
7. How can we apply the message of this passage in our daily lives?
