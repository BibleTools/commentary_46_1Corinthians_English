# Themes

First, let's briefly summarize the passage. In 1 Corinthians 1:18-31, the apostle Paul contrasts the wisdom of God with the wisdom of the world. He argues that the message of the cross seems foolish to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God. Paul then goes on to explain that God's wisdom is not like the world's wisdom. The world values human wisdom, strength, and status, but God uses what the world considers weak and foolish to shame the wise and strong.

Now, let's examine the key themes expressed in this passage:

1. The message of the cross is the power of God.
Paul emphasizes that the message of the cross is not just a human philosophy or clever argument, but the power of God to save people. This theme underlines the centrality of the gospel and the importance of preaching Christ crucified.

2. The wisdom of God is different from the wisdom of the world.
Paul argues that the wisdom of God is not based on human intelligence or achievement, but on the revelation of God. The world's wisdom is often based on pride and self-promotion, while God's wisdom is based on humility and submission to God.

3. God uses the foolish and weak things of the world to shame the wise and strong.
Paul emphasizes that God chooses to use what the world considers weak and foolish to accomplish his purposes. This theme emphasizes the sovereignty of God in choosing who he uses for his work and the importance of humility and dependence on God.

Now, let's explore how biblical Greek studies help us understand each theme:

1. The word "power" in Greek is "dunamis," which connotes both the ability and the energy to accomplish something. This emphasizes that the message of the cross is not only powerful in its ability to save, but also energizing and life-giving.

2. The word "wisdom" in Greek is "sophia," which carries the idea of practical wisdom, not just intellectual knowledge. This emphasizes that God's wisdom is not just theoretical, but also practical and applicable to everyday life.

3. The word "foolish" in Greek is "moros," which means foolishness in the sense of being morally corrupt or worthless. This emphasizes that the foolishness of the cross is not just a lack of human wisdom, but a reversal of values where what is considered worthless by the world is actually valuable to God.

As for theological implications of this passage, it shows us that God's wisdom is not understood or valued by the world. We cannot rely on human wisdom to comprehend the gospel or live out our faith, but need to depend on the revelation of God through the Holy Spirit. This passage also highlights the importance of humility, submission to God's will, and valuing what God values over what the world values.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this New Testament passage in several ways. For example, the idea of God using the weak and foolish things of the world to accomplish his purposes can be seen in the story of Gideon in Judges 6-7, where God chooses a small and weak army to defeat a much larger and stronger one. Other Old Testament passages that relate to this theme include Psalm 118:22, Isaiah 29:14, and Isaiah 64:4.

Ultimately, the message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by showing us that we need to approach him with humility, acknowledge our own weakness and foolishness, and depend on his wisdom and power. It also encourages us to value what God values and not be swayed by the opinions or values of the world.
