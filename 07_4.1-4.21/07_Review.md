# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verses 1-2, Paul talks about being a "steward of the mysteries of God." What does it mean to be a steward? What are the mysteries of God? Why is it important for stewards to be faithful?

2. In verses 3-4, Paul writes that it doesn't matter to him whether he is judged by human courts or by God. Why do you think he says this? What does this tell us about how Christians should view human judgment?

3. In verses 6-7, Paul writes that he and Apollos are just servants of God, and that God is the one who causes growth. Why do you think he emphasizes this point? What does this tell us about our role as Christians?

4. In verses 8-13, Paul uses irony to criticize the Corinthians for their pride and arrogance. What specific examples does he give of their behavior? How do these examples illustrate the folly of boasting in human wisdom?

5. In verses 14-21, Paul contrasts his own behavior with the behavior of the Corinthians. What specific actions does he take to demonstrate his humility and love? How do these actions provide a model for us as Christians?
