1 Corinthians 4:1-21 is a powerful passage that gives us insight into the folly of boasting in human wisdom. Throughout this passage, Paul is addressing a problem that was prevalent in the Corinthian church during his time. Some members of the church were boasting about their own wisdom and knowledge, while others were being belittled and dismissed.

Paul begins by reminding the Corinthians that they should view him and Apollos as servants of Christ, who have been entrusted with the mysteries of God. He emphasizes that they should not be judged by human standards, but rather by the Lord's judgment, who will judge their motives and actions.

Paul then goes on to challenge the Corinthians' attitudes of boasting in human wisdom. He asks them a series of rhetorical questions that force them to examine their hearts and motives. He points out that godly wisdom is not found in the wisdom of the world, but in the foolishness of the cross. He reminds them that their faith should not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.

Furthermore, Paul highlights the irony of the Corinthians' boasting in their own wisdom when they were actually lacking in discernment and spiritual maturity. He exposes their hypocrisy and pride, and urges them to repent and turn back to God.

In conclusion, this passage teaches us that we should not boast in our own wisdom or knowledge, but rather in the wisdom and power of God. We should seek to be servants of Christ who are faithful stewards of the mysteries of God, rather than using our knowledge to belittle and dismiss others. We should also examine our own hearts and motives, and ensure that our faith is grounded in the power of God rather than in the wisdom of men.
