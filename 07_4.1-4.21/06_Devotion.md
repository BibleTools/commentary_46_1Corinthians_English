# Devotion

As I read through 1 Corinthians 4:1-21, I am struck by the Apostle Paul's warning against boasting in human wisdom. In this passage, Paul reminds us that we are merely servants of Christ, entrusted with the task of sharing the gospel message with others.

It's easy to get caught up in our own intellect, relying on our own understanding and abilities to accomplish great things. But as Paul reminds us, true wisdom and power come from God alone. When we become too reliant on our own wisdom, we risk falling into pride and arrogance, believing that we have all the answers and that our way is the best way.

But Paul warns us that this kind of thinking is foolishness. He reminds us that God's ways are higher than our ways, and that our understanding is limited. It's only through humility and a willingness to submit to God's will that we can truly gain wisdom and discernment.

As I reflect on this passage, I am reminded of my own tendency to rely on my own understanding and abilities. It's easy to think that I have all the answers, or that I know what's best for me and those around me. But the truth is, my understanding is limited, and my wisdom is flawed.

Instead of relying on myself, I need to turn to God and seek His wisdom and guidance. I need to acknowledge that I am merely a servant of Christ, entrusted with the task of sharing His message with others. And as I do so, I can trust that He will give me the wisdom and discernment I need to fulfill this task.

So let us not boast in our own human wisdom, but instead let us humbly submit to God's will and seek His guidance in all that we do. May we be faithful servants of Christ, sharing His message with love and humility, and trusting in His power to bring about true transformation in the lives of those we encounter.

Let us pray:

Heavenly Father,

We come before you today with humble hearts, acknowledging that all wisdom and knowledge come from you. We repent of any pride in our hearts and any reliance on our own understanding. As we meditate on this passage from 1 Corinthians 4, we pray that you would give us the grace to embrace your wisdom and to reject any worldly wisdom that leads to boasting.

Help us to understand that we are mere stewards of the mysteries of God, and that it is only by your grace that we are able to understand and share these mysteries with others. Keep us from the folly of boasting in our own wisdom, and grant us the humility to recognize that all good things come from you.

We pray that you would give us a heart for the lost and the broken, and that we would seek to share your wisdom with them in a way that is loving and compassionate. Help us to remember that our ultimate goal is not to impress others with our knowledge, but to bring them to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.

In all that we do, may we give you the glory and honor that you deserve, for you alone are worthy of all praise. We ask all of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Amen.
