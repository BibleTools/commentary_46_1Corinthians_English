# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 23, Paul says that "all things are lawful," but not all things are helpful or edifying. What does he mean by this? How can we discern what is helpful or edifying for ourselves and others?

2. In verse 24, Paul says that "no one should seek their own good, but the good of others." What does this look like in practice? How can we prioritize the good of others over our own desires or preferences?

3. In verse 25, Paul uses the example of buying meat in the market. How does this example illustrate the principle of seeking the good of others? How can we apply this principle in our own daily lives?

4. In verses 26-30, Paul talks about not causing others to stumble in their faith. How can we avoid causing others to stumble? What are some common stumbling blocks in our culture today?

5. In verses 31-33, Paul summarizes the importance of seeking the good of others in all things. How can we live out this principle in our relationships with others? What are some practical ways we can love and serve those around us?

6. In chapter 11, Paul urges the Corinthians to imitate him as he imitates Christ. How can we imitate Christ in seeking the good of others? What are some specific ways that Christ modeled this principle during his life and ministry?
