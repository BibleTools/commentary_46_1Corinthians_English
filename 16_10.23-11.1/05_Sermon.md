# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today's passage from 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1 reminds us of the importance of seeking the good of others. In this passage, Paul is addressing the issue of eating food that has been sacrificed to idols. He acknowledges that while all things are permissible, not all things are beneficial. We have the freedom to do what we want, but we should always consider how our actions will affect those around us.

The context of this passage is important to understand. In the culture of Corinth, it was common for meat to be sacrificed to idols before being sold in the marketplace. Some believers were concerned that eating this meat would be participating in idol worship, while others felt that since idols have no real power, it was acceptable to eat the meat. Paul is urging the Corinthians to consider how their actions will affect others, especially those who are weaker or less knowledgeable in their faith.

The main message of this passage is that our actions should always be motivated by love for others. We should not be so focused on our own freedoms that we forget about the impact our actions have on those around us. As Christians, we are called to love one another and to put the needs of others before our own. This is exemplified in verse 24, which says, "Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others."

The message that I want us to take away from this passage today is that we should always be mindful of how our actions affect others. We may have the freedom to do certain things, but if they cause others to stumble, we should refrain from doing them. We should seek to build up one another and to promote unity within the church.

To make this message relevant to our lives today, we can think about how our actions on social media or in our personal relationships affect those around us. We should be careful not to post or say things that could be hurtful or divisive. We should also be willing to put aside our own desires and preferences for the sake of others.

In conclusion, let us remember the words of Paul in verse 31, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." Let us seek to glorify God by loving one another and seeking the good of others. May we always be mindful of how our actions affect those around us and may we build up one another in love.

In Jesus' name, Amen.
