# Application

1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1 teaches us about the importance of seeking the good of others in our daily lives. In this passage, the Apostle Paul encourages the Corinthians to think about others in all that they do, and to prioritize the good of others above their own desires and preferences.

In verse 23, Paul writes, "Everything is permissible," meaning that we have freedom in Christ to make choices in our lives. However, he also reminds us that not everything is beneficial or constructive. We must be mindful of how our choices will affect others, and choose to do what is best for them, even if it means sacrificing our own desires.

Paul goes on to explain that our ultimate goal in life should be to glorify God and to build up others. In verse 24, he writes, "No one should seek their own good, but the good of others." This means that we should be looking for opportunities to serve and help others, rather than just focusing on our own needs and wants.

Furthermore, Paul emphasizes the importance of considering the needs and feelings of those around us, especially those who may be weaker or more vulnerable. In verse 32, he writes, "Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God." This means that we should avoid doing things that may cause others to sin or to stumble in their faith.

Finally, Paul points us to the example of Christ, who lived a life of selflessness and service to others. He writes, "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (11:1). We should strive to imitate Christ in our daily lives, seeking to serve others and to put their needs before our own.

In practical terms, applying this passage to our lives means being intentional about looking for opportunities to serve and help others. It means being willing to put aside our own desires and preferences in order to do what is best for those around us. It means being mindful of how our actions and choices will affect others, and choosing to act in ways that build them up and help them grow.

Overall, the message of this passage is clear: as followers of Christ, we are called to seek the good of others in all that we do. By doing so, we not only honor God, but we also contribute to the growth and well-being of those around us.
