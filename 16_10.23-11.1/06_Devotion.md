# Devotion

As Christians, we are called to seek the good of others in all that we do. In 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1, Paul reminds us of this important truth. He tells us that even though we have freedom in Christ, we should not use our freedom to pursue selfish desires or harm others. Instead, we should always seek to build others up and bring glory to God.

When we seek the good of others, we reflect the love and compassion of Christ. We show others that we care about their well-being and are willing to put their needs before our own. This is particularly important in a world where people often prioritize their own interests at the expense of others.

To apply this passage to our own lives, we must first examine our motives. Are we seeking to build ourselves up or are we focused on the well-being of those around us? Are our actions bringing glory to God or are they driven by selfish desires?

We can also look for opportunities to serve others. This might mean volunteering in our community, reaching out to a friend who is struggling, or simply being kind and compassionate in our interactions with others. By doing so, we not only benefit those around us, but we also grow in our own faith and character.

Ultimately, seeking the good of others is a reflection of our love for God. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10:31, “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.” When we prioritize the good of others, we demonstrate our commitment to God’s kingdom and the values of the gospel.

Let us then seek to follow in the footsteps of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve others (Matthew 20:28). May our actions be a reflection of his love and compassion, and may we always seek the good of those around us.

Let us pray:

Heavenly Father,

I come before you with a heart full of gratitude for your immeasurable love and grace that you have lavished on me. I ask that you help me to seek the good of others, just as Christ did, and to put their needs before my own desires.

As I navigate through life, I pray for wisdom and discernment, to understand that not everything is beneficial and that some things may cause harm to those around me. Help me to make choices that reflect my love for others.

May my actions be a reflection of Christ's love, and may I seek to glorify you in all that I do. Help me to be selfless, to put others first, and to always seek the good of those around me.

Lord, guide me and empower me to live a life that is pleasing to you, and may my actions serve as a testament to your love and grace.

In Jesus' name, I pray,
Amen.
