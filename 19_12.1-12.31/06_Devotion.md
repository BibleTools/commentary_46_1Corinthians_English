# Devotion

Dear friends,

1 Corinthians 12:1-31 speaks about spiritual gifts and the need for order in worship. In this passage, Paul emphasizes the importance of unity and diversity within the church, and how each member has a unique role to play in the body of Christ. 

As we reflect on this passage, we are reminded that we have all been given spiritual gifts by God. These gifts are not for our own benefit, but for the benefit of the church and for Godâ€™s glory. We must use our gifts to serve others, rather than seeking our own personal gain. 

At the same time, Paul also stresses the importance of order in worship. He reminds us that all things should be done decently and in order, and that we should not seek to draw attention to ourselves during worship. Instead, we must focus on glorifying God and edifying one another. 

As we apply this passage to our own lives, we should ask ourselves: What gifts has God given us? How can we use these gifts to serve others in the church? And how can we ensure that our worship is focused on glorifying God and edifying one another, rather than seeking our own personal gain?

Perhaps we have been given the gift of hospitality, and we can use this gift to welcome newcomers to our church and make them feel at home. Or maybe we have the gift of teaching, and we can use this gift to lead a Bible study or Sunday school class. Whatever our gifts may be, let us use them to serve others and build up the church.

Let us also remember that order is important in worship. We should not seek to draw attention to ourselves, but focus on God and His Word. This means avoiding distractions, such as talking or using our phones during worship. Instead, let us come to worship with a humble and reverent heart, ready to receive from God.

In conclusion, let us strive to use our spiritual gifts to serve others in the church, while also maintaining order in worship. May we always seek to glorify God and edify one another, and may our worship be a reflection of our love for Him.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you today with humble hearts, acknowledging that you are the giver of all good things, including the spiritual gifts that we have received. We thank you for the diversity of gifts that you have given to your church, recognizing that each one is important and necessary for the edification of the body.

We pray that we would use our gifts in a way that brings glory to your name and advances your kingdom. Help us to understand that no one gift is more important than another and that we are all dependent on one another to function properly.

We ask that you would help us to use our gifts in an orderly way during our times of worship. May our worship be a reflection of your character, bringing honor and praise to your name. Help us to be sensitive to your leading during our times of worship, recognizing that your presence is what we truly seek.

We ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Amen.
