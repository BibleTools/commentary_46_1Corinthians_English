# Application

1. Recognize the diversity of spiritual gifts: The passage emphasizes that there are a variety of gifts given to believers by the Holy Spirit for the common good of the church. These gifts include wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, discernment, tongues, and interpretation of tongues. It's important to recognize that not everyone will have the same gifts, and that's okay. We need each other and our unique contributions to function effectively as a body of believers.

2. Avoid comparison and competition: The passage warns against comparing and competing with one another based on our gifts. Instead, we should honor and value each other's gifts as equally important and necessary for the functioning of the body. This means not boasting about our gifts or belittling others who may have different gifts than us.

3. Prioritize love: The passage emphasizes that the use of spiritual gifts must be motivated by love. Love is the foundation for all spiritual gifts and without it, they are meaningless. This means using our gifts in a way that benefits others and builds up the church, not simply for our own personal gain or recognition.

4. Follow the order and structure of worship: The passage also emphasizes the need for order and structure in worship services. This includes having designated leaders, guidelines for the use of spiritual gifts, and a focus on edification and unity. Disorder and chaos in worship can be disruptive and confusing, so it's important to follow the guidelines set forth by church leadership and to use spiritual gifts in a way that contributes to the overall order and effectiveness of the service.

5. Seek understanding and growth: Finally, the passage encourages believers to seek understanding and growth in their spiritual gifts. This means taking the time to learn more about the gifts we have been given, how to use them effectively, and how to develop them further. It also means being open to correction and feedback from others, and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit in how we use our gifts.

In summary, this passage reminds us of the importance of recognizing and valuing the diversity of spiritual gifts, avoiding comparison and competition, prioritizing love, following the order and structure of worship, and seeking understanding and growth in our spiritual gifts. By applying these principles to our lives, we can contribute to the edification and unity of the church and use our gifts in a way that brings glory to God.
