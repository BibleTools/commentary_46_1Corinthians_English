# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 35, Paul poses a hypothetical question: "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?" What do you think is motivating Paul to ask this question, and what is he trying to address with his answer?

2. In verses 36-38, Paul uses the example of a seed that is planted and grows into a new plant to illustrate the concept of resurrection. What does this metaphor tell us about the nature of resurrection, and how does it apply to our understanding of the afterlife?

3. In verses 39-41, Paul draws a comparison between different types of flesh and different types of celestial bodies. What is Paul trying to communicate through this comparison, and what implications does it have for our understanding of the resurrection body?

4. In verses 42-44, Paul contrasts the "natural body" with the "spiritual body." What is the difference between these two types of bodies, and how does this contrast help us understand the nature of the resurrection body?

5. In verses 45-49, Paul draws a comparison between the "first man" (Adam) and the "second man" (Christ). What is Paul trying to communicate through this comparison, and how does it relate to his discussion of the resurrection body?

6. Finally, how does our understanding of the resurrection body impact our daily lives as Christians? What hope and assurance does this passage offer us as we look towards the future?
