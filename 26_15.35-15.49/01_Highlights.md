In 1 Corinthians 15:35-49, Paul discusses the nature of the resurrection body. The passage begins with a rhetorical question about what kind of body people will have in the resurrection. Paul responds by using the analogy of a seed to explain the transformation that will take place.

Paul explains that just as a seed is sown and a new plant emerges, so too will our earthly bodies be sown and our resurrection bodies will emerge. Our earthly bodies are perishable, but our resurrection bodies will be imperishable. They will be raised in power, glory, and spiritual nature.

The passage goes on to explain that our current bodies are natural, but our resurrection bodies will be spiritual. This does not mean that our bodies will be immaterial, but rather that they will be animated by the Spirit and under its control. Our current bodies are also physical, but our resurrection bodies will be transformed to be fit for eternity.

Paul then contrasts the first Adam, who was made of dust and gave us our earthly bodies, with the second Adam, Jesus, who gives us our resurrection bodies. Just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we will also bear the image of the heavenly man.

In summary, the nature of the resurrection body is imperishable, raised in power, glory, and spiritual nature. It will bear the image of the second Adam, Jesus, and be transformed to be fit for eternity.
