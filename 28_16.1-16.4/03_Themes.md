# Themes

1 Corinthians 16:1-4 is a passage where Paul is instructing the Corinthians on how to collect funds for the saints in Jerusalem who were experiencing a severe famine. There are several key themes expressed in this passage:

1. Giving: Paul instructs the Corinthians to set aside money on the first day of every week, emphasizing the importance of consistent and intentional giving. This theme is also echoed in 2 Corinthians 9:7, where Paul states that "each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."

2. Community: The funds collected were for the benefit of the saints in Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of community and caring for one another. This theme is also seen in Acts 2:44-45, where the early believers shared everything they had with one another.

3. Stewardship: Paul emphasizes the responsibility of leaders in handling financial gifts, ensuring that they are used for their intended purpose. This theme is also present in Luke 12:42-44, where Jesus teaches that faithful and wise stewards are those who use their resources to serve others.

Biblical Greek studies show us that the word used for "collection" in this passage is "logia," which can also be translated as "sayings" or "oracles." This suggests that the act of giving was not just a financial transaction, but an expression of faith and obedience to God's word.

In terms of theological implications, this passage highlights the importance of generosity and caring for others, which are central values in the Christian faith. It also demonstrates the unity of believers across different regions and cultures, as the Corinthians were collecting funds for Jerusalem.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage by highlighting the themes of community and hospitality. For example, Deuteronomy 15:7-11 instructs the Israelites to be generous to those in need, while Leviticus 19:34 commands them to love foreigners as themselves.

Overall, this passage reminds us of the importance of giving and caring for one another as members of the Christian community. It also challenges us to use our resources wisely and responsibly, in accordance with God's will.
