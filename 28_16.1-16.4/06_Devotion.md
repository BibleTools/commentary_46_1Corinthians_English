# Devotion

1 Corinthians 16:1-4 says:

"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also: On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come. And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem. But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me."

This passage is about Paul's instruction to the Corinthians about collecting an offering for the Jerusalem church. Paul had given similar orders to the churches in Galatia, and he expected the Corinthians to follow suit. 

While this passage may not seem immediately applicable to our modern lives, there are some important principles that we can take away from it. Firstly, the passage emphasizes the importance of giving to support the needs of the church community. Paul instructs believers to give as they are prospered, indicating that giving is not just a one-time act but an ongoing commitment. We may not be collecting money for specific needs within the church today, but we are still called to give generously to support the work of the gospel in our communities and around the world.

Secondly, the passage speaks to the importance of planning and preparation. Paul instructs the Corinthians to set aside offerings "on the first day of the week," indicating that they should make giving a regular part of their routine. By doing this, they will be prepared to give when the time comes and ensure that there is no scrambling or confusion when it comes to collecting the offering.

Finally, the passage highlights the importance of accountability in giving. Paul tells the Corinthians that they should choose a trustworthy person to deliver their gift to Jerusalem. In doing so, they can be confident that their offering will be put to good use and that it will reach those who need it most. Similarly, we should be careful about where and how we give our resources, ensuring that we are supporting legitimate and effective ministries.

As we reflect on this passage, let us consider how we can give generously to support the work of the gospel, how we can make giving a regular part of our routine, and how we can ensure that we are giving in a way that is accountable and effective. May we be faithful stewards of the resources that God has given us, using them to further his kingdom and bring glory to his name.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you today with grateful hearts, thanking you for your abundant grace and mercy in our lives. We are humbled by your love and the sacrifice of your Son, Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again.

As we reflect on this passage from 1 Corinthians 16, we are reminded of the importance of supporting our brothers and sisters in Christ. We pray that you would give us the heart of generosity and devotion towards those in need.

Lord, we ask that you would bless the work of our hands and provide us with the resources to give generously to those who are struggling. We pray for the wisdom to use our resources wisely and for discernment to know where our help is needed most.

May we be faithful stewards of all that you have entrusted to us, and may our giving bring glory to your name. We pray for the unity of your church and that we may always support one another in love and devotion.

We ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.
