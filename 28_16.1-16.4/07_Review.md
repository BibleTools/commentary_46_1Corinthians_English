# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 1, Paul instructs the Corinthian church to "do the same as I instructed the Galatian churches." What might this suggest about the nature of Paul's teachings and their relationship to various communities of faith?

2. Verse 2 emphasizes the importance of giving "on the first day of every week." Why do you think Paul might have chosen this specific instruction?

3. Paul mentions setting aside money "in keeping with [one's] income." What might this reveal about the early Christian understanding of financial giving? How does this compare to modern Christian practices?

4. In verse 3, Paul says that he will send "whomever [the Corinthians] approve" to deliver the collected funds to Jerusalem. What might this say about the early Christian value of community participation and decision-making?

5. Finally, verse 4 emphasizes the importance of giving "in order to prove [one's] love." What might Paul mean by this? How might this idea of giving as a demonstration of love apply to our own lives and relationships today?
