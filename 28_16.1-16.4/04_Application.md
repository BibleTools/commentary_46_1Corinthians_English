1 Corinthians 16:1-4 is a short passage in which Paul encourages the Corinthians to make a collection for the saints in Jerusalem. The passage reads:

“Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do. On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come. And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.”

At first glance, this passage may not seem particularly applicable to our daily lives, but there are several insights that we can draw from it:

1. Giving is a regular practice: Paul instructs the Corinthians to set aside something each week for the collection. This suggests that giving should be a regular practice in our lives, not just a sporadic or occasional thing. By setting aside a portion of our income or possessions each week, we can develop a habit of generosity and make a meaningful impact on those in need.

2. Giving is proportional to prosperity: Paul instructs the Corinthians to give “as he may prosper.” This suggests that our giving should be proportional to our income or resources. As we prosper, we should be willing to give more generously. This is not to say that we should give beyond our means, but rather that we should be willing to sacrifice and prioritize giving in our budget.

3. Giving is a practical way to meet needs: Paul’s collection for the saints in Jerusalem was not a theoretical or abstract exercise, but a practical way to meet the needs of fellow believers. When we give generously, we can make a tangible impact on the lives of others and demonstrate the love and compassion of Christ.

4. Giving requires trust and accountability: Paul’s plan for the collection involved sending trusted messengers to carry the gift to Jerusalem. This suggests that giving requires trust and accountability. We should seek out reputable organizations and individuals to whom we can give with confidence, and we should be accountable for how our giving is used.

In summary, 1 Corinthians 16:1-4 teaches us that giving should be a regular, proportional, practical, and accountable practice in our lives. By following these principles, we can make a meaningful impact on the lives of others and honor God with our resources.
