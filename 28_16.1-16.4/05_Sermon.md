# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today's passage from 1 Corinthians 16:1-4 addresses the topic of collecting money for the saints. The context of this passage is important to understand. The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the church in Corinth, a city in Greece, to address various issues of concern. One of these issues was the collection of money for the saints in Jerusalem who were facing hardship.

Paul writes in verse 1, "Now about the collection for the Lord's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do." Here, Paul is referring back to the instructions he gave to the churches in Galatia to collect money for the saints in Jerusalem. He is now urging the Corinthians to do the same.

The main message or theme of this passage is giving generously to support the needs of others. In verse 2, Paul instructs the Corinthians to set aside a portion of their income "on the first day of every week." He emphasizes the importance of regular and intentional giving.

The message or lesson that I want you to take away from this sermon is that giving to support the needs of others is a crucial aspect of our Christian faith. Just as the Corinthians and Galatians were called to give generously to support the saints in Jerusalem, we are also called to give generously to support those in need.

This passage is relevant and applicable to our lives today because there are still people in our communities and around the world who are facing hardship and need our support. By giving generously, we can demonstrate our love for God and our love for others.

Let me offer some examples of how we can give generously. We can give financially to our local church, to organizations that serve the poor and disadvantaged, and to those affected by natural disasters. We can also give of our time and talents to serve others in our community.

However, there may be challenges or objections to giving generously. Some may argue that they don't have enough money to give or that they don't trust organizations to use their donations wisely. These challenges can be addressed by emphasizing the importance of regular and intentional giving, and by researching and supporting organizations with a proven track record of using donations effectively.

It is also important to clarify that giving generously is not about earning God's favor or buying our way into heaven. Rather, it is about reflecting God's love and generosity towards others. As Paul writes in verse 3, "Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem."

In conclusion, let us remember that giving generously to support the needs of others is an essential aspect of our Christian faith. May we be intentional and regular in our giving, and may we trust that God will use our gifts to bless those in need. Amen.
