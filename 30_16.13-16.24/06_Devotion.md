# Devotion

Dear friends,

As we come to the end of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, we find a section that might be easy to gloss over: a list of instructions and greetings. However, even in these seemingly minor details, we can find important truths and lessons for our own lives.

First, let's remember the context of this passage. Paul has just given the Corinthians some specific instructions about collecting money for the church in Jerusalem. Now, he is wrapping up the letter and giving final words of encouragement and advice.

In verse 13, Paul gives a simple but powerful command: "Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong." These words are just as relevant to us today as they were to the Corinthians. We live in a world that often challenges our faith and tries to pull us away from God's truth. But if we stand firm in our faith, we can withstand those challenges and remain strong.

Next, Paul gives some specific instructions about a man named Apollos. He encourages the Corinthians to welcome him and to support him in his travels. This is a reminder that we are all part of a larger community of believers, and we should be willing to support and encourage one another.

Finally, Paul sends some personal greetings to various members of the Corinthian church. These brief mentions remind us that even in the midst of a larger message, individual people matter. We should take the time to greet and encourage one another, just as Paul does here.

Overall, this passage reminds us to be vigilant in our faith, to support one another as members of the body of Christ, and to value each individual person in our community of believers. May we take these lessons to heart and put them into practice in our own lives.

Let us pray:

Heavenly Father,

We come before You today with hearts full of devotion and gratitude. We give You thanks for the wisdom and guidance that Your Word provides us. As we meditate on this passage from 1 Corinthians 16:13-24, we ask for Your strength and courage to live out the instructions and greetings that are presented to us.

Help us to be watchful and stand firm in our faith, to be men and women of courage that are not afraid to take a stand for Your truth. May we always be mindful of the love that we have for one another, and show kindness and hospitality to all we encounter. May our hearts be filled with joy as we fellowship with our brothers and sisters in Christ.

May Your grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love undying, and may we be faithful in all that we do, knowing that our labor in the Lord is not in vain.

We pray that You would bless us and keep us, that You would make Your face shine upon us and be gracious to us, and that You would turn Your face towards us and give us peace.

In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
