# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be exploring the last chapter of the book of 1 Corinthians, specifically focusing on verses 13-24. In this passage, the apostle Paul gives instructions and greetings to the church in Corinth, and we can draw valuable lessons from his words.

Firstly, let us consider the context of this passage. Paul wrote this letter to the church in Corinth, a bustling city in Greece that was known for its immorality and idol worship. The Corinthian church was struggling with various issues, including division, sexual immorality, misuse of spiritual gifts, and doubts about the resurrection. Paul wrote this letter to address these issues and to guide the Corinthian believers back to the teachings of Christ.

In verse 13, Paul encourages the Corinthians to “be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.” These words are just as relevant to us today as they were to the Corinthians. We must be vigilant in our faith, standing firm in our beliefs and being courageous in the face of opposition. We must draw our strength from God, who is our source of power and wisdom.

In verse 14, Paul instructs the Corinthians to “do everything in love.” This is a powerful reminder that our actions must be motivated by love for God and for others. Love is the foundation of our faith, and it should guide all our decisions and interactions.

In verses 15-18, Paul mentions various individuals who are sending greetings to the Corinthians. This is a reminder that we are not alone in our faith. We are part of a larger community of believers who support and encourage one another.

In verse 19, Paul emphasizes the importance of hospitality and caring for one another. He writes, “The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.” We should follow the example of Aquila and Priscilla, who opened their home to fellow believers and offered them hospitality.

In verses 20-21, Paul warns the Corinthians against false teachers and false doctrines. He writes, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’” We must be discerning in our beliefs and be wary of teachings that contradict the word of God.

Finally, in verses 22-24, Paul offers a closing benediction, expressing his love for the Corinthians and for Christ. He writes, “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.” This is a powerful reminder that we are saved by grace, and that our salvation and our love for one another are rooted in Christ.

In conclusion, this passage offers valuable instructions and greetings to the church in Corinth, and to us as well. We must be vigilant in our faith, motivated by love and guided by the teachings of Christ. We must support and encourage one another, offer hospitality, and be discerning in our beliefs. May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with us all, now and forevermore. Amen.
