# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 13, Paul exhorts the Corinthians to "be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong." What do you think he means by each of these phrases, and how might we apply them in our own lives today?

2. In verse 14, Paul tells the Corinthians to "do everything in love." Why do you think he emphasizes the importance of love here, and how might this relate to the rest of his message in this passage?

3. In verses 15-18, Paul thanks several individuals by name for their contributions to the Corinthian church. What can we learn from his recognition of these individuals, and how might we apply this principle in our own communities?

4. In verse 19, Paul asks the Corinthians to "greet one another with a holy kiss." What do you think he means by this, and how might we apply this practice in a culturally appropriate way today?

5. In verses 20-22, Paul warns the Corinthians to "keep away from idols." How might this warning apply to us today, and what are some potential "idols" that we might need to be on guard against in our own lives?

6. In verses 23-24, Paul sends final greetings and blessings to the Corinthian church. What can we learn from his words here, and how might we apply these blessings to our own lives and communities?
