# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today's message comes from the book of 1 Corinthians, specifically chapter one, verses ten through seventeen. In this passage, the Apostle Paul addresses a problem that was causing division within the church in Corinth. The problem was that the believers were choosing sides and aligning themselves with different leaders, such as Paul, Apollos, or Cephas.

Paul begins by urging the Corinthians to be united in their thinking and to avoid divisions. He reminds them that Christ is the one who unites us, and that we should all share the same mind and the same purpose. He then goes on to ask them, "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (1 Corinthians 1:13). Paul is making it clear that their loyalty should be to Christ, not to any human leader.

This message is just as relevant today as it was in Paul's time. Too often we see divisions within the church, as people align themselves with different pastors, denominations, or theological perspectives. But just as Paul urged the Corinthians to be united in their thinking, we too must strive for unity.

Our loyalty should always be to Christ, who unites us as one body. It's not about which pastor or church we attend, but about our shared belief and trust in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. When we focus on our differences, we create unnecessary divisions that can hinder our effectiveness in spreading the gospel and loving others.

So my message to you today is this: let us strive for unity in the body of Christ. Let us focus on our shared purpose and our shared faith in Jesus Christ. Let us put aside any differences or divisions, and work together to fulfill the great commission of making disciples of all nations.

May God bless you all as you seek to serve Him and love others. Amen.
