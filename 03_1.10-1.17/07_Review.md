# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. What is the main issue that Paul is addressing in this passage?
2. How do you think the Corinthians' divisions were affecting the church?
3. Paul urges the Corinthians to "be united in the same mind and same judgment" (v. 10). What do you think he means by this? How can we apply this to our own church community?
4. Paul lists four different groups in verses 12-13 (those who follow Paul, Apollos, Cephas, and Christ). Why do you think he mentions these specifically? How do these divisions compare to divisions in the church today?
5. Paul emphasizes the importance of baptism in verse 17. What is the significance of baptism, and how does it relate to the issue of divisions in the church?
6. How can we strive for unity in the church while still acknowledging diversity and different perspectives within the body of Christ?
7. In what ways do you see divisions within the church today? How can we work towards greater unity and understanding?
8. What is the role of humility in combating divisions within the church? How can we cultivate a spirit of humility and open-mindedness towards different perspectives and opinions?
