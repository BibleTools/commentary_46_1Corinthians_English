# Context

The passage of 1 Corinthians 1:10-17 addresses the problem of divisions among the Corinthian church. Paul, in his opening remarks, appeals to the Corinthians to be of the same mind and the same judgment. He then goes on to identify the problem he has heard of through reports from members of the church - that there are quarrels among them, and each faction aligning themselves with a different leader. 

To better understand the historical context of this passage, we need to consider the situation in Corinth at the time. Corinth was a diverse city with various cultures and religions, which resulted in the church being made up of people from different backgrounds with different beliefs and practices. At the same time, there was a culture of sophistry and rhetoric, where people were impressed by the eloquence of speakers rather than the content of their message. This context made it easy for various leaders to gain followers based on their rhetorical abilities, leading to divisions within the church.

Moreover, the early Christian community faced intense persecution from both the Jews and the Roman authorities. The Jewish community saw Christianity as a heresy and a threat to their beliefs, while the Roman authorities saw Christians as subversive and potentially dangerous to the established order. This context of persecution added to the struggles of the early Christians, ultimately leading to the martyrdom of many.

When Paul addresses the divisions in the Corinthian church, he emphasizes the centrality of the cross and the unity it brings to believers. He reminds the Corinthians that they were baptized in the name of Christ and not in the name of any particular leader. He appeals to them to put aside their human loyalties and instead focus on the message of the gospel.

Understanding the Jewish culture of the time also provides insight into the passage. The Jewish community had a strong sense of identity and belonging based on their national identity and religious practices. In contrast, the Corinthians were from diverse backgrounds and had no shared cultural identity beyond their faith in Christ. This meant that they needed to learn to put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and focus on their shared identity in Christ.

In conclusion, 1 Corinthians 1:10-17 speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced in maintaining unity in the face of diversity and persecution. Understanding the historical and cultural context of the passage highlights the challenges that the early church faced in bringing together people from different backgrounds and cultures. Ultimately, the message of the passage emphasizes the centrality of Christ and the need for believers to put aside their human loyalties and focus on the message of the gospel.
