# Devotion

In 1 Corinthians 16:5-12, Paul shares his travel plans with the church in Corinth. He intends to visit them after passing through Macedonia, but he doesn't want to stay long because he feels called to continue his ministry elsewhere. While this passage may seem like a simple travel itinerary, it holds an important message about the need for unity among believers.

Paul's emphasis on unity can be seen in his request for the church in Corinth to "make every effort to come together in peace" (v. 11). He recognizes that there are divisions within the church and urges them to reconcile and work together. As believers, we are called to be united in Christ, and this means putting aside our differences and working towards a common goal.

One practical way we can apply this message to our lives is by actively seeking out unity with other believers. This can mean reaching out to someone with whom we have had a disagreement and seeking to reconcile, or working together with others in our church or community to further God's kingdom. It also means putting aside our own desires and agendas and seeking to serve others instead.

Ultimately, Paul's travel plans and emphasis on unity remind us that we are all part of the same body of Christ. We may have different roles and ministries, but we are all working towards the same goal of spreading the gospel and bringing glory to God. Let us, therefore, make every effort to come together in peace and unity, putting aside our differences and working towards a common goal.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father, 

As I come before you today, I am reminded of the importance of unity among your people. We are all called to work together for your glory, and to fulfill the mission you have given us. 

Lord, I pray that you would help us to be united in your love and in your purpose. May we be supportive of one another, always seeking to build each other up and encourage one another in the faith. 

As we read in 1 Corinthians 16:5-12, Paul had his travel plans, but he was also open to changing them if it meant serving your people better. Help us to be like Paul in this way, willing to put our own plans and desires aside for the sake of others. 

I pray that you would guide us in our own plans and decisions, and give us the wisdom to discern what is best for your Kingdom. Help us to be sensitive to your leading, and to be obedient to your will. 

Thank you for your faithfulness and your love. May we continue to grow in our devotion to you, and may we always seek unity in your name. 

In Jesus' name, 

Amen.
