# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. Why do you think Paul is so focused on his travel plans in this passage? What does this reveal about his priorities as a leader?

2. How does Paul's desire to visit the Corinthians relate to his larger mission as an apostle and evangelist? How does he see his role in spreading the gospel?

3. What does Paul mean when he talks about "opportunities" in verse 9? In what ways do we as Christians need to be ready to seize opportunities to share the gospel and serve others?

4. How does Paul's instruction to "be on your guard" (verse 13) relate to the theme of unity that runs throughout this letter? Why is it important for the Corinthians to remain vigilant against threats to their faith and harmony?

5. How can we apply the message of this passage to our own lives and communities? What does it look like to prioritize unity and mission in the context of our own churches and ministries?
