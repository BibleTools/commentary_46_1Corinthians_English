1. Commitment and faithfulness to the mission of spreading the Gospel 
2. The importance of unity and harmonious relationships within the church

Paul expresses his commitment to the mission of spreading the Gospel in his travel plans. He plans to visit Corinth after passing through Macedonia, indicating his willingness to go to great lengths to ensure that the message of Christ is proclaimed. This theme of commitment is further emphasized by his intention to stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, indicating a steadfast and unwavering dedication to his calling.

The importance of unity and harmonious relationships within the church is also highlighted in this passage. Paul urges the Corinthians to support and assist his fellow workers, indicating that a spirit of cooperation and teamwork is essential to the success of the mission. He also emphasizes the need to interact with one another in love, suggesting that conflict and division can be damaging to the unity of the church.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand each theme in greater detail. For example, the Greek word used for "faithful" in verse 9 ("Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. All the brethren send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.") can also be translated as "trustworthy" or "reliable", emphasizing the importance of dependability and consistency in carrying out the mission.

The theological implications of this passage relate to the nature of God's plan for humanity and the role of the church in fulfilling that plan. The commitment and dedication of Paul and his fellow workers reflects the faithfulness and steadfastness of God in carrying out his redemptive plan for humanity. The emphasis on unity and love within the church reflects the character of God and his desire for his people to live in harmony and cooperation with one another.

The Old Testament contributes to our comprehension of this New Testament passage in several ways. For example, the theme of commitment to the mission of spreading the Gospel is reflected in the faithfulness of the prophets in proclaiming God's message to the people of Israel. Similarly, the importance of unity and love within the church is emphasized in the Old Testament through passages such as Psalm 133, which speaks of the blessings of unity among God's people.

The message conveyed in this passage impacts our connection with God by reminding us of our responsibility to work together as a unified body to fulfill God's mission. It also emphasizes the importance of dependability and commitment to the task at hand. Ultimately, the message of this passage calls us to a deeper sense of devotion to God and to one another, as we seek to fulfill his plan for our lives and for the world.
