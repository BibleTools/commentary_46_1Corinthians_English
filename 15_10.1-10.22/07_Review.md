# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 1-4, Paul refers to the Israelites' experience in the wilderness. How does Paul use their experience to warn the Corinthians against idolatry?
2. What does it mean to partake in the "cup of the Lord" and the "cup of demons" (verse 21)? How do we avoid participating in idolatry through our actions and attitudes?
3. In verse 12, Paul warns the Corinthians to be careful, lest they fall. How does this warning apply to us today, and how can we guard against idolatry in our lives?
4. In verses 18-22, Paul discusses the importance of unity in the body of Christ. How does idolatry threaten this unity, and what steps can we take to maintain it?
5. What are some modern-day examples of idolatry, and how can we guard against them in our lives and in the church?
