We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verse 20, Paul refers to Christ as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep. What does this mean, and why is it significant?

2. Why does Paul emphasize the importance of Christ's resurrection in verses 21-22? What is the connection between Adam's sin and our own mortality?

3. In verses 23-24, Paul talks about the timing of the resurrection. What does he mean by "each in his own order"? 

4. In verses 29-34, Paul responds to those who deny the resurrection of the dead. What arguments does he use to support the reality of the resurrection? 

5. Why does Paul use the metaphor of "baptism for the dead" in verse 29? What does he mean by this?

6. In verse 32, Paul quotes the phrase "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." What is he trying to convey with this quote?

7. What practical implications does the reality of the resurrection have for our lives as believers? How should it shape the way we live and think?
