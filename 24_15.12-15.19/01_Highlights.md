In 1 Corinthians 15:12-19, Paul addresses the issue of some Corinthians denying the resurrection of the dead. He argues that if there is no resurrection, then Christ himself has not been raised, and if Christ has not been raised, then the Christian faith is meaningless. 

Paul begins by asserting that if Christ is proclaimed as having been raised from the dead, then how can some among them say there is no resurrection of the dead? He then goes on to outline the implications of denying the resurrection. 

Firstly, if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ himself has not been raised. This is a crucial point, as the resurrection of Christ is a central tenet of the Christian faith. If Christ has not been raised, then the Christian faith is essentially a fraud. 

Secondly, if Christ has not been raised, then the apostles' preaching is in vain and their faith is futile. The apostles' entire message is based on the resurrection of Christ, so if that is not true, then their message is worthless. 

Thirdly, if Christ has not been raised, then the Corinthians' faith is also in vain. If Christ has not been raised, then the promises of the gospel are empty and there is no hope for salvation. 

Fourthly, if Christ has not been raised, then the apostles are liars and the Corinthians are still in their sins. The resurrection of Christ is the proof that God has accepted Christ's sacrifice on behalf of humanity. If that resurrection did not occur, then there is no proof that God has accepted Christ's sacrifice and therefore no forgiveness of sins. 

Finally, if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christians are the most to be pitied of all people. Paul is saying that if the Christian faith is not based on reality, then it is the most pathetic and hopeless of all belief systems. 

In summary, Paul argues that the denial of the resurrection of the dead undermines the very foundations of the Christian faith. If Christ has not been raised, then the Christian message is meaningless, and believers are still in their sins. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is not just an important doctrine, but a fundamental reality that gives meaning and hope to the Christian life.
