In 1 Corinthians 14:26-40, the apostle Paul addresses the issue of decent and orderly worship in the Corinthian church. He begins by affirming the importance of each member bringing something to contribute to the meeting, whether it be a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. However, Paul emphasizes that everything should be done for the edification of the church, rather than for personal glory or attention.

Furthermore, Paul cautions against chaos and confusion in worship, stating that everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way. He specifically addresses the use of tongues, saying that they should only be spoken if there is someone present to interpret, otherwise the speaker should remain silent. This is because speaking in tongues without interpretation does not benefit the listeners.

Paul also gives instructions regarding the role of women in worship, stating that they should remain silent and not speak in the assembly. He justifies this by appealing to the Law and to the practice of the churches.

Overall, Paul's message emphasizes the importance of decent and orderly worship that is focused on edifying the church. He encourages the use of spiritual gifts, but cautions against their misuse, and provides guidelines for their proper use. Finally, he addresses the roles of women in worship, based on his understanding of Scripture and the practices of the churches.
