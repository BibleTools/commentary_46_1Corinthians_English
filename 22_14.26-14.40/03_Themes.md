# Themes

1 Corinthians 14:26-40 discusses the importance of decent and orderly worship in the Church. 

Themes:
1. Edification: The primary purpose of worship is to edify and build up the Church. Paul emphasizes this by stating that all things done in the Church should be for the edification of the Church. This includes speaking in tongues, prophecy, and the interpretation of tongues.

2. Orderliness: Paul stresses the importance of orderliness in worship. He states that everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way. This is important for the edification of the Church, as chaos and disorder will only serve to confuse and hinder the members.

3. Submission: Paul emphasizes the need for submission in worship. He states that all things should be done in a way that is respectful to others and honors the authority of God. This includes the submission of women in worship, as they are to remain silent and not speak in the Church.

Biblical Greek studies help us understand each theme through the use of specific words and phrases. For example, the word "edification" is translated from the Greek word "oikodome," which means "to build up" or "to strengthen." The word "orderly" is translated from the Greek word "eutaxia," which means "good order" or "well-arranged." These words give us a deeper understanding of the importance of edification and orderliness in worship.

The passage has several theological implications, including the importance of edification and orderliness in worship, the need for submission, and the honoring of God's authority. Additionally, the passage offers guidance on the use of spiritual gifts in worship and emphasizes the importance of speaking in a way that is understandable to others.

Old Testament Connection:
The passage connects to the Old Testament through the concept of submission and the importance of honoring God's authority. For example, in Isaiah 45:23, God declares that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess to Him. This emphasizes the authority and sovereignty of God, and the need for submission to His will.

Connection with God:

It also emphasizes the need for submission to God's authority and the use of spiritual gifts for the building up of the Church.
