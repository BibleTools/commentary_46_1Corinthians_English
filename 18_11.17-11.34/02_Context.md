In 1 Corinthians 11:17-34, the apostle Paul addresses the issue of the Lord's Supper and the need for unity in the Corinthian church. During this time, the Corinthian church was struggling with issues of factionalism and division, and this was creating problems during their observance of the Lord's Supper. 

Paul begins by noting that the Corinthian church was not observing the Lord's Supper in the right way. He criticizes them for the way they were coming together, saying that their meetings were causing more harm than good. He notes that some were coming together for the Lord's Supper but were not actually partaking in it, while others were overindulging in food and drink before the Supper, leaving nothing for those who arrived late. 

Paul's commentary on the Lord's Supper highlights the historical context of the early Christian church. The Lord's Supper was an important part of early Christian worship, and it was a time when the members of the church would come together to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The early church was made up of people from different backgrounds and cultures, and the Lord's Supper was a unifying practice. However, in Corinth, the practice had become divisive, with some members being excluded and others overindulging. 

To address these issues, Paul reminds the Corinthians of the significance of the Lord's Supper, saying that it is a time to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and to proclaim his death until he comes again. He emphasizes the importance of unity in the church, saying that when they come together to observe the Lord's Supper, they should do so in a way that includes everyone and does not exclude anyone. 

Paul's comments on the Lord's Supper and the need for unity highlight the struggles that early Christians faced in their efforts to maintain a cohesive community. The early church was made up of people from different backgrounds and cultures, and these differences sometimes led to conflict and division. The Lord's Supper was an important practice that helped to unify the church, but it was not immune to the problems that were affecting the rest of the community. Paul's insights into the historical context of the early church help us to better understand the challenges that Christians faced in trying to live out their faith in a diverse and often contentious world.
