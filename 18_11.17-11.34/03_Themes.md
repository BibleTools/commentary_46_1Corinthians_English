# Themes

1 Corinthians 11:17-34 is a passage that discusses the institution of the Lord's Supper and the need for unity among believers. The key themes expressed in this passage include the importance of self-examination, the need for unity, and the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice.

The first theme, self-examination, is presented in verses 27-28. Paul urges believers to examine themselves before partaking of the Lord's Supper so that they do not eat and drink judgment on themselves. This theme emphasizes the need for personal reflection and repentance before approaching the table of the Lord.

The second theme, the need for unity, is emphasized in verses 18-19 and 33-34. Paul criticizes the division that exists among the Corinthian believers during the celebration of the Lord's Supper. He urges them to come together and to wait for one another. This theme highlights the importance of unity in the body of Christ and the need for believers to have a common purpose and vision.

The third theme, the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice, is emphasized in verses 23-26. Paul reminds the Corinthians of the words of Jesus on the night he was betrayed, when he took bread and wine and said that they were his body and blood. This theme emphasizes the significance of the Lord's Supper as a time of remembrance and reflection on the sacrifice of Jesus for our sins.

Biblical Greek studies can help us understand each theme more deeply. For example, the Greek word for "examine" in verse 28 is "dokimaz≈ç," which means to test, scrutinize or prove. This word emphasizes the need for believers to carefully examine their hearts and motives before partaking of the Lord's Supper.

The theological implications of this passage are significant. The emphasis on personal reflection and repentance highlights the importance of personal holiness and a right relationship with God. The emphasis on unity demonstrates that the church is meant to be a community of believers who are committed to one another and to the mission of the gospel. Finally, the emphasis on the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice reminds us of the centrality of the cross in our faith and the need to continually reflect on the work of Christ in our lives.

The Old Testament contributes to our comprehension of this New Testament passage in a number of ways. For example, the Passover meal in Exodus 12 is a foreshadowing of the Lord's Supper, and provides a background for the theme of remembrance in 1 Corinthians 11. Additionally, the emphasis on unity in the church has roots in the Old Testament, where God's people were called to be a holy nation and a light to the nations.

In conclusion, the passage of 1 Corinthians 11:17-34 emphasizes the importance of self-examination, unity, and the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice. These themes have significant theological implications and remind us of the centrality of personal holiness, community, and the gospel in our lives.
