# Devotion

Dear friends,

In 1 Corinthians 11:17-34, the apostle Paul teaches us about the Lord's Supper and the importance of unity in the Church. In this passage, Paul addresses the issues of division and selfishness that were present in the Corinthian church during the celebration of the Lord's Supper.

First, let us fully understand the context of this passage. The Corinthian church struggled with divisions and factions, as some members claimed to follow Paul or Apollos, while others followed Peter or Christ (1 Corinthians 1:10-17). This division was also evident during the Lord's Supper, where some would eat and drink without regard for others or the significance of the occasion.

Paul rebukes this behavior, reminding the Corinthians of the solemn and sacred nature of the Lord's Supper. He emphasizes that it is not merely a casual meal, but rather a remembrance of Christ's sacrifice on the cross for our sins (1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Therefore, we must approach the Lord's Supper with reverence and unity, as we partake in the same body and blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 10:17).

As we reflect on this passage, we must consider how it applies to our own lives and experiences. Are we guilty of selfishness or division in our churches? Do we approach the Lord's Supper with reverence and thanksgiving, or do we take it for granted?

The message or lesson that God may be trying to communicate through this passage is the importance of unity in the Church. We are called to be one body in Christ, and our actions should reflect that unity. By humbling ourselves and putting the needs of others before our own, we can demonstrate Christ's love and bring glory to God.

Therefore, let us focus on the theme of unity in our devotion. We must strive to be united as one body in Christ, recognizing that we are all equal and part of the same family. We must love one another, forgive one another, and encourage one another to grow in our faith.

Practically speaking, this means that we should actively seek out opportunities to serve and love others in our churches. We can also strive to be peacemakers, seeking to resolve conflicts and promote unity. And as we participate in the Lord's Supper, let us do so with gratitude and reverence, remembering the sacrifice of Christ and the unity we share as His body.

Let us pray: 

Dear Heavenly Father,

As we come before you in prayer, we ask for your wisdom and guidance as we reflect on the passage of 1 Corinthians 11:17-34. Lord, we understand that this passage is a call for unity as we partake in the Lord's Supper. We pray for unity in the body of Christ, may we put aside our differences and come together as one to partake in this holy sacrament.

Lord, we ask for your forgiveness for any divisions that we have caused within the body of Christ. We pray that we may be reconciled with one another, and that we may be of one mind and one spirit, as we partake in your holy supper.

Lord, as we partake in the bread and the cup, we pray for a renewed sense of devotion and commitment to you. May we be reminded of the sacrifice that you made for us on the cross, and may we be filled with gratitude for your love and grace.

Lord, we pray for your blessings upon us as we partake in this holy sacrament. May we be strengthened in our faith, and may we be empowered to live lives that honor you.

We pray all of this in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Amen.
