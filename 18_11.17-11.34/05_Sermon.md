# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

As we gather together today to partake in the Lord's Supper, I want to take a moment to reflect on the words of the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34. In this passage, Paul addresses the need for unity among believers and the importance of properly discerning the body and blood of Christ during communion.

Firstly, it's important to understand the context of this passage. Paul wrote this letter to the church in Corinth, a city that was known for its divisions and conflicts. The Corinthian church had become divided over various issues, including social status and spiritual gifts. In this particular passage, Paul was addressing a problem with the way they were conducting the Lord's Supper. Some were eating and drinking to excess, while others were being excluded or going hungry.

The main message of this passage is that the Lord's Supper is a symbol of our unity in Christ. We are all one body, and we partake in the same bread and wine to remember the sacrifice that Jesus made for us. When we come together to share in this meal, we are proclaiming our faith in Christ and our commitment to one another as members of his body.

As we prepare to partake in the Lord's Supper today, I want to remind us of the message and lesson that we can take away from this passage. We need to approach this meal with reverence and respect, recognizing the significance of what it represents. We need to be mindful of our brothers and sisters in Christ, making sure that everyone is included and no one is left out. We need to be willing to come together in unity, setting aside our differences and focusing on the things that unite us.

In order to make this sermon relevant and applicable to our lives, we need to reflect on our own attitudes towards unity and communion. Are there ways in which we have been divisive or exclusive towards others? Are there people in our church community who feel left out or marginalized? How can we work towards greater unity and inclusivity, both in our church and in our wider community?

To illustrate these points, I want to share a personal story. In my own life, I have struggled with feelings of isolation and loneliness. It wasn't until I started attending church and participating in communion that I truly felt a sense of belonging and community. The Lord's Supper has become a powerful symbol of my connection to Christ and to my fellow believers.

Finally, I want to address any potential challenges or objections that someone might have to this message. Some may argue that unity should not come at the expense of truth or moral standards. While that is certainly true, we must also recognize that our unity in Christ should transcend our differences and disagreements. We can disagree on certain issues and still come together as brothers and sisters in Christ.

In conclusion, as we partake in the Lord's Supper today, let us remember the words of the apostle Paul and the importance of unity in the body of Christ. Let us discern the body and blood of Christ with reverence and respect, and let us commit ourselves to greater unity and inclusivity in our church and in our wider community. May the Lord bless us as we partake in this meal together.

Amen.
