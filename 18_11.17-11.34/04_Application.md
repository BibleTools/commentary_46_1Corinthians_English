In 1 Corinthians 11:17-34, the apostle Paul addresses the church in Corinth concerning their observance of the Lord's Supper. He expresses his concern that the Corinthians have been treating the Lord's Supper as a common meal, and that in doing so, they are failing to recognize its true significance.

Paul reminds the Corinthians of the origins of the Lord's Supper, which was instituted by Jesus Himself on the night before His death (1 Corinthians 11:23-26). He emphasizes that when they partake of the bread and cup, they are participating in the body and blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 11:27), and that they must do so in a manner that reflects the seriousness and solemnity of the occasion.

However, Paul also brings attention to the issue of disunity that exists within the church in Corinth. He notes that there are factions and divisions among them (1 Corinthians 11:18), and that this is evident even during the observance of the Lord's Supper. Some of the Corinthians are eating and drinking in a selfish manner, while others go hungry and are humiliated (1 Corinthians 11:20-22).

Paul identifies this lack of unity and love as the reason why some of the Corinthians are sick and weak, and why others have even died (1 Corinthians 11:30). He urges the Corinthians to examine themselves before partaking of the Lord's Supper, so that they may avoid judgment (1 Corinthians 11:28-29).

Therefore, the application of this passage to our daily lives requires us to recognize the significance of the Lord's Supper and to approach it with reverence and respect. We must also examine ourselves to ensure that we are not partaking of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner. Furthermore, we must strive for unity and love within the church, and avoid any actions or attitudes that may cause division. By doing so, we can honor Christ and experience the fullness of His blessings in our lives.
