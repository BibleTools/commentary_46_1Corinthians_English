# Devotion

In 1 Corinthians 9:1-27, Paul sets an example of self-denial for the sake of the Gospel. Paul was a man who had every right to demand compensation and support for his ministry, yet he chose to give up these rights in order to reach more people with the message of Christ.

As we reflect on this passage, we can see how it applies to our own lives. How often do we hold on to our own rights and privileges, even when they might be hindering our ability to serve God and others? We may be tempted to demand recognition, compensation, or even just our own way, but Paul's example reminds us that true sacrifice means giving up our own desires for the greater good of God's Kingdom.

Paul's message also reminds us that the growth of the church is not about building up our own personal empires or seeking our own glory, but about advancing the cause of Christ. It's about reaching those who are lost and in need of salvation. We must be willing to give up our own desires and preferences in order to serve others and share the good news of Jesus Christ.

As we strive to live out Paul's example of self-denial, we can also take comfort in the fact that God will reward us for our faithfulness. Paul writes in verse 18, "What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel." When we give up our own rights and privileges for the sake of the Gospel, we may not receive earthly recognition or compensation, but we can trust that God will reward us in heaven.

Let us pray:

Dear God,

As I come before you today, I pray that you would fill my heart with the same devotion and selflessness that Paul displayed in his ministry. Help me to deny myself for the sake of your gospel, just as he did, freely giving up my own desires and preferences for the sake of others.

Lord, I pray for a heart that desires to serve others, to meet their needs, and to share the good news of your salvation. Give me the strength to endure hardships, to persevere through trials, and to never lose sight of the ultimate goal - the salvation of souls.

May I never seek my own gain or glory, but always strive to bring glory to your name. May my life be a living testimony to your grace and mercy, and may others be drawn to you through my words and actions.

Lord, I thank you for the example of Paul and for the truth of your word. Help me to walk in obedience to your will, to trust in your provision, and to remain steadfast in my devotion to you.

In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
