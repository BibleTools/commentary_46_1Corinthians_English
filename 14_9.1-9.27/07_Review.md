# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. In verses 1-2, Paul defends his apostolic authority. What does it mean to be an apostle? How do Paul's experiences and qualifications support his claim to be an apostle?

2. In verses 3-14, Paul argues that he has the right to be supported by the churches he ministers to, but he has chosen not to exercise that right. Why does Paul choose not to accept financial support? What does this say about his motivation for ministry?

3. In verses 15-23, Paul explains his approach to evangelism. What does it mean to become all things to all people? How does this approach express Paul's commitment to the gospel?

4. In verses 24-27, Paul uses the metaphor of a race to describe his own ministry. What does it mean to run in such a way as to get the prize? How can we apply this principle to our own lives?

5. In light of this passage, what can we learn about self-denial, evangelism, and ministry? How can we apply these lessons to our own lives as followers of Christ?
