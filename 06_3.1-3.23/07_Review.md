# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions:

1. What kind of language does Paul use to describe the Corinthians in verses 1-3? Why do you think he uses this language?
2. In verse 4, what does Paul say is the root of the divisions among the Corinthians? What is the danger of this?
3. How does Paul describe his role in the Corinthians' spiritual growth in verse 6? What does this teach us about the importance of God in our spiritual development?
4. What does Paul mean when he says that each person's work will be "revealed by fire" in verse 13? How does this relate to the quality of our work as Christians?
5. In verses 18-20, Paul contrasts the wisdom of the world with the wisdom of God. How does this relate to the Corinthians' immaturity and failure to understand the gospel?
6. What is the significance of Paul's statement in verse 23 that all things belong to the Corinthians because they belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God?
