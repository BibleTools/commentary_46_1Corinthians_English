In 1 Corinthians 3:1-23, Paul addresses the immaturity of the Corinthians and their failure to understand the gospel. He begins by admonishing them for their carnal behavior, stating that he cannot address them as spiritual people, but as infants in Christ. He emphasizes that they are still worldly, evidenced by their jealousy and strife, and that they are not ready for solid food but must continue to be nourished with milk.

Paul also criticizes their tendency to align themselves with human leaders, stating that this is a sign of their worldly thinking. He reminds them that the church is not about human leaders, but about Jesus Christ, who is the foundation of the church. He warns them that their works will be judged by fire, and that they should build on the foundation of Christ with materials that will survive this judgment.

Paul then goes on to explain that the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight, and that the true wisdom comes from God. He reminds the Corinthians that all things belong to them, but they belong to Christ, and that they are to be stewards of the mysteries of God.

In summary, Paul's message in this passage is a call for the Corinthians to mature in their faith, to stop their childish behavior, and to put their trust in Christ as the true foundation of the church. He emphasizes the importance of building on this foundation with materials that will withstand judgment, and of seeking true wisdom from God rather than relying on the wisdom of the world.
