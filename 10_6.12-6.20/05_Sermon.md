# Sermon

My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, we gather today to reflect upon the sanctity of the body and the importance of sexual purity, as outlined in 1 Corinthians 6:12-20.

In this passage, the apostle Paul reminds us that our bodies are not our own, but rather belong to God. As such, we are called to honor God with our bodies, using them in a way that brings glory to Him.

Paul specifically addresses the issue of sexual immorality, urging us to flee from it and instead pursue sexual purity. He reminds us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and that engaging in sexual immorality is a sin against our own bodies.

It can be easy in our modern culture to dismiss sexual purity as old-fashioned or outdated. However, Paul's message remains as relevant today as it was over two thousand years ago. We live in a world that glorifies sexual promiscuity and objectifies the human body. But as followers of Christ, we are called to resist these cultural pressures and instead uphold the sanctity of our bodies.

So what does this mean for us in practical terms? It means avoiding pornography, premarital sex, and any other behavior that dishonors God and degrades our bodies. It means treating our own bodies and the bodies of others with respect, recognizing that they are not objects to be used for our own pleasure.

It also means acknowledging that sexual sin can have serious consequences, both spiritually and physically. While we know that God is a forgiving God, we must also recognize the damage that sexual sin can inflict on our relationships, our health, and our own sense of self-worth.

But perhaps most importantly, it means recognizing that our bodies are not just vessels for our own pleasure or comfort. They are gifts from God, and as such, we are called to use them to serve Him and bring glory to His name.

So as we go forth from this place, let us recommit ourselves to the sanctity of the body and the pursuit of sexual purity. Let us honor God with our bodies, using them as instruments of His love and grace in a world that so desperately needs it. Amen.
