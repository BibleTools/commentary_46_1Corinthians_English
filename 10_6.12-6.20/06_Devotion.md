# Devotion

As we read through the Bible, we come across many verses that remind us of the sanctity of our bodies and the importance of sexual purity. One such passage is found in 1 Corinthians 6:12-20. 

This passage speaks to the Corinthians about the importance of treating our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit. We are reminded that our bodies are not our own, but rather, they belong to God. Therefore, we must honor God with our bodies and avoid sexual immorality.

In today's society, sexual promiscuity is often celebrated and considered normal behavior. However, as Christians, we are called to a higher standard of purity. We must remember that our bodies are not just physical vessels, but also spiritual ones. When we engage in sexual immorality, we are not only dishonoring God, but we are also damaging our own souls.

Paul tells us that sexual sin is a sin against our own bodies. We are called to flee from sexual immorality and to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace. It is important to remember that we are not alone in this battle. God promises to provide a way out of temptation and to give us the strength we need to resist sexual sin.

As we reflect on this passage, let us remember the sanctity of our bodies and the importance of sexual purity. Let us honor God with our bodies and flee from sexual immorality. May we seek God's strength and guidance in living lives of purity and holiness. 

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We thank You for the gift of our bodies, which You created in Your own image and for Your glory. We recognize that our bodies are not our own but are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we ask for Your help in keeping them pure and holy.

We confess to You that we have sinned against our bodies and against You, by engaging in sexual immorality and defiling the temple of Your Spirit. We ask for Your forgiveness and Your strength to resist temptation and to honor You with our bodies.

We pray for those who struggle with sexual sin, that You would give them the power of Your Spirit to overcome temptation and to walk in purity. We pray for those who have been wounded by sexual sin, that You would heal their hearts and restore their sense of worth and dignity.

Help us to value our bodies as You do, to use them for Your purposes and to glorify You in all that we do. May we be empowered by Your Spirit to live lives that are pleasing to You and that bring honor to Your holy name.

In Jesus' name we pray,

Amen.
