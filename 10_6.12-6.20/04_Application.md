1 Corinthians 6:12-20 is a powerful passage that speaks to us about the sanctity of the body and the importance of sexual purity. In this passage, Paul reminds us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and that we are not our own, but we belong to God. Therefore, we should honor God with our bodies and keep them pure.

The passage begins with Paul stating that “all things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable” (v. 12). This means that while there may be things that are technically allowed, they may not be beneficial for us. In the context of this passage, Paul is referring specifically to sexual immorality and how it can harm our bodies and our relationship with God.

Paul then goes on to say that our bodies are not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord (v. 13). This means that we should not use our bodies for things that are contrary to God’s will, but rather we should use them to glorify Him.

In verse 15, Paul reminds us that our bodies are members of Christ and that we should not unite them with a prostitute. This is a powerful statement that reminds us of the gravity of sexual sin and how it can damage our relationship with Christ.

Paul then goes on to say that sexual immorality is a sin against our own bodies (v. 18). This means that when we engage in sexual sin, we are not only sinning against God, but we are also harming ourselves. Sexual sin can have physical, emotional, and spiritual consequences that can damage our wellbeing and our relationship with God.

Finally, Paul reminds us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (v. 19). This means that the Holy Spirit dwells within us and that we should treat our bodies with reverence and respect. We should not defile our bodies with sexual sin, but rather we should keep them pure and holy.

Overall, this passage teaches us that our bodies are sacred and that we should honor God with them. We should not engage in sexual sin but rather keep ourselves pure and holy. We should always remember that we belong to God and that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. May we always honor God with our bodies and keep them pure and holy for His glory.
