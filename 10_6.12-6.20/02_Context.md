# Context

The passage of 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 speaks to the struggles that early Christians faced with regard to sexual purity and the sanctity of the body. In the historical and cultural context of the time, Corinth was known for its temple prostitutes and sexual promiscuity. The city was also heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, which often saw the body as something base and to be rejected in favor of the soul or spirit.

In this context, the idea of sexual purity and the sanctity of the body would have been a radical idea for many early Christians. Paul is addressing a specific issue in the Corinthian church where some members were engaging in sexual immorality, likely with prostitutes or in other illicit ways.

By emphasizing the importance of the body and its connection to Christ, Paul is attempting to counter the pagan and philosophical ideas that would have devalued the physical world. He argues that the body is not something to be exploited but rather a temple of the Holy Spirit, belonging to God and inextricably linked to the resurrection of Christ.

In this way, Paul is calling on early Christians to resist the cultural influences of their time and uphold a high standard of sexual morality. He reminds them that their bodies are not their own but belong to Christ and should be treated with the utmost respect and care. This would have been a challenging message for many to hear, as it went against the prevailing attitudes of the time.

Furthermore, an understanding of Jewish culture would have aided in the interpretation of this passage as well. In Judaism, the body was seen as a gift from God that should be used to serve Him. Sexual relations were reserved for marriage and were seen as sacred and holy. Paul draws on this tradition by emphasizing the importance of sexual purity and the sanctity of the body as something that is set apart for God's purposes.

Overall, a deeper comprehension of the historical and cultural context of 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 helps us to better understand the struggles that early Christians faced with regard to sexual purity and the sanctity of the body. By seeing the passage in this context, we can appreciate the radical nature of Paul's message and the challenges that early Christians would have faced in upholding such high standards in a culture that valued sexual promiscuity and rejected the physical world.
