# Devotion

1 Corinthians 13 is a beautiful reminder of the supremacy of love and its proper use in the exercise of spiritual gifts. In this chapter, the apostle Paul challenges the Corinthian church to prioritize love above all else, even over the spiritual gifts they held in high esteem.

As I reflect on this passage, I am struck by how easy it is to get caught up in the pursuit of spiritual gifts while neglecting the most important aspect of our faith - love. We often desire the gifts of prophecy, healing, and tongues, but fail to reflect the love of Christ in our daily interactions with others.

Paul reminds us that even if we have the gift of tongues, prophesy or faith, without love, we are nothing. Love is the foundation upon which all other gifts must be built. Love is not just an emotion, but an action that should be demonstrated in how we treat others.

As Christians, our ultimate goal is to reflect Christ's love to others. This love is sacrificial and selfless, putting the needs of others before our own. It is a love that seeks to serve and not to be served. This kind of love is impossible to achieve on our own, but through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can exhibit this kind of love to others.

In conclusion, the message of 1 Corinthians 13 is clear: love is the most important gift that we can possess. It is the foundation on which all other gifts should be built. As we pursue spiritual gifts, let us not forget the importance of love. Let us seek to exhibit Christ's love in all that we do and say. May we love others as Christ has loved us, putting their needs before our own. Let us pray that the Holy Spirit empowers us to love selflessly and sacrificially, so that we can reflect the love of Christ to a hurting and broken world.

Let us pray:

Dear heavenly Father,

You are the source of all love, and Your love is greater than anything we can comprehend. We ask that You fill us with Your love so that we may love others the way You love us. Help us to see others with Your eyes and to extend kindness and compassion to all.

As Your children, we are blessed with spiritual gifts that we can use to serve Your kingdom. But without love, our gifts are meaningless. We pray that You help us use our spiritual gifts for the sake of others and not for our own benefit. May we use our gifts to build up and encourage those around us.

We also ask that You teach us to be patient and kind, to not envy or boast, to not be arrogant or rude, to not insist on our own way, and to not be irritable or resentful. Help us to bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things. May Your love guide us in all that we do.

Thank You for Your great love for us, and for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ. We pray all of this in His name.

Amen.
