# Themes

1 Corinthians 7:17-40 is a passage in which Paul discusses the topic of remaining single and devoted to the Lord. There are several key themes expressed in this passage:

1. Living according to God's call: Paul emphasizes that each person should live according to the calling that God has given them. Whether married or single, each person has a unique mission in life that they should fulfill with God's help.

2. Contentment in one's present situation: Paul advises that those who are single should remain content in their present situation rather than be anxious to get married. He also advises those who are married to remain content in their marriage rather than seek a divorce.

3. Focusing on the Lord: Regardless of one's marital status, Paul emphasizes that the most important thing is to focus on the Lord and serve Him with all one's heart, mind, and strength.

Biblical Greek studies can help us understand each of these themes more deeply. For example, the Greek word used for "calling" (klēsis) emphasizes that each person has a unique purpose and mission in life that they should fulfill with God's help. The word used for "contentment" (autarkēs) emphasizes a sense of inner sufficiency and satisfaction that comes from relying on God rather than external circumstances. And the word used for "focusing" (perispandō) emphasizes a sense of concentration and single-mindedness in one's pursuit of God.

An example that aids our understanding is the following: Paul uses the example of circumcision and uncircumcision to illustrate the idea that external circumstances (such as marital status) are not as important as one's commitment to the Lord. He emphasizes that what matters is keeping God's commandments and living in a way that honors Him.

The theological implications of this passage are significant. It reminds us that our relationship with God is the most important thing, and that whatever our circumstances, we should seek to honor Him and serve Him with all our heart. It also highlights the importance of contentment and trusting in God's plan for our lives.

The Old Testament contributes to our understanding of this passage in several ways. For example, the story of Joseph (who remained single and devoted to God even in difficult circumstances) illustrates the idea that one's relationship with God is more important than external circumstances. The book of Ecclesiastes also emphasizes the importance of contentment and finding satisfaction in God rather than external pleasures.

Overall, the message conveyed in this passage is that we should seek to honor God and serve Him with all our heart, regardless of our marital status. By focusing on God and trusting in His plan for our lives, we can find contentment and fulfillment in whatever circumstances we find ourselves in.
