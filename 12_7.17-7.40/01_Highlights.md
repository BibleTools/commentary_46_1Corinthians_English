In 1 Corinthians 7:17-40, Paul addresses the Corinthians' questions about marriage and singleness. He emphasizes that regardless of one's marital status, the most important thing is to remain devoted to the Lord. 

Paul encourages those who are already married to stay in their marriage, but for those who are single, he advises them to remain single if they can do so while still devoting themselves to the Lord. He explains that being single allows for more undivided attention to the things of the Lord, and that those who are single can serve the Lord in a unique way. However, he acknowledges that not everyone has the gift of singleness and that it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

Paul also addresses those who are engaged, saying that if they can remain unmarried, they should do so, but if they cannot control their desires, they should go ahead and get married.

Overall, Paul's message is that both marriage and singleness can be used to serve the Lord and that the most important thing is to remain devoted to Him in whichever state one finds themselves.
