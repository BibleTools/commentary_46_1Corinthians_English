# Devotion

1 Corinthians 7:17-40 is a passage that may not often be thought of as providing spiritual guidance on remaining single, but it is a rich source of wisdom for those who have chosen to remain single and devoted to the Lord. In this passage, the Apostle Paul addresses the Corinthian church regarding a number of relational issues, including marriage, divorce, and singleness.

One of the key themes that emerges in this passage is the idea that our circumstances, whether single or married, do not determine our value or worth in God's eyes. Paul reminds the Corinthians that "God has called us to live in peace" (v. 15), and that whether married or single, we can honor and serve God in our current situation. In fact, Paul suggests that remaining single may actually be preferable in some instances, as it allows for greater focus and devotion to the Lord (v. 32-35).

As we reflect on this passage and its relevance to our own lives, we may be inclined to view singleness as a limitation, a state that prevents us from experiencing the joys and blessings of marriage. But Paul's words challenge us to consider the ways in which singleness can actually be a gift, a unique opportunity to serve God and pursue His purposes without distraction.

For those of us who have chosen to remain single, it can be easy to feel isolated or misunderstood, particularly in a world that often places a high value on romantic relationships. But as we meditate on this passage, we are reminded that we are never truly alone, and that our worth and significance come not from our relationship status or achievements, but from our identity in Christ.

So whether we are single or married, let us seek to honor God in all that we do, recognizing that our circumstances do not define us, but rather provide an opportunity to grow and serve in unique and meaningful ways. May we find joy and contentment in our singleness, knowing that we are loved and valued by our Heavenly Father, and that our lives have purpose and meaning beyond anything we could ask or imagine.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

We come before you today to thank you for the gift of singleness and for the freedom it gives us to fully focus on your work. Help us to remain devoted to you in every aspect of our lives, whether we are single or married.

We pray for your guidance as we navigate the challenges of remaining faithful to you in a world that often promotes self-gratification and worldly pursuits. Give us the strength to resist temptation and to remain steadfast in our commitment to you.

We pray for those who are struggling with the desire for marriage, that you would comfort them in their loneliness and remind them that they are never truly alone because you are with them always. Help them to find fulfillment and purpose in serving you and your kingdom.

We also pray for those who are married, that they would continue to prioritize their relationship with you above all else. Help them to be an example of your love and grace to their spouse and to the world around them.

Thank you for your constant love and provision in our lives. May we always remain devoted to you, in singleness or in marriage.

In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
