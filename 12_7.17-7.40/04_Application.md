# Application

1 Corinthians 7:17-40 provides guidance for those who are single and devoted to the Lord. In this passage, the apostle Paul advises that it is good to remain as you are – whether married or single – and that each person should remain in the situation that God has called them to.

For those who are unmarried, Paul encourages them to remain single like he is, as this allows them to focus on serving the Lord without the distractions and responsibilities of marriage. However, he acknowledges that not everyone has the gift of singleness and that it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

For those who are married, Paul advises that they should not seek to separate from their spouse, but if they do, they should remain unmarried or be reconciled to their spouse. He also addresses the situation of those who are married to unbelievers, advising them to remain with their spouse if the unbeliever is willing to live with them and to be a positive influence on their spouse and children.

So how can we apply these teachings to our daily lives? For those who are single, it is important to remember that being single is not a second-class status, but rather an opportunity to serve the Lord fully without the distractions of a spouse and family. We can use this time to deepen our relationship with God, pursue our passions, and serve others.

For those who are married, we can apply Paul's teachings by recognizing that marriage is a sacred covenant that should not be taken lightly. We can strive to love and honor our spouse, even in difficult times, and seek to be a positive influence on them and our children. If we are married to an unbeliever, we can seek to love and serve them in a way that reflects Christ's love for us.

Overall, the teachings in this passage remind us to seek God's will for our lives and to be content in the situation that He has called us to. Whether married or single, we can use our lives to serve the Lord and bring glory to Him.
